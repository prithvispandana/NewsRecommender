Improvements in life expectancy have almost "ground to a halt", a leading academic has warned. Professor Sir Michael Marmot said he was "deeply concerned" that increases in life expectancy had levelled off since 2010. He said the stagnation needs "urgent" investigation. Historically, improvements in life expectancy at birth had been around a one year increase every five years for women and every three and a half years for men.
