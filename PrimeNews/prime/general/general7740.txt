A staggering 1,000 “corrections” to EU law will be made without MPs necessarily voting on them, through the controversial “Repeal Bill”. The vast number of “statutory instruments” to be passed – some under so-called “Henry VIII powers” – will heighten suspicions of a Government power grab. The legislation will also switch across up to 20,000 EU regulations into UK law to prepare for departure day when Brexit is completed in March 2019.
