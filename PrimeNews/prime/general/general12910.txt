(AP) â€” Hundreds of family, friends and community members in Pennsylvania gathered for a vigil to remember four missing young men who were killed and their remains buried on a sprawling family farm.  According to court papers, DiNardo, 20, who graduated from a Catholic prep school two years ago, said he killed Patrick, a former schoolmate, when he arrived with $800 to buy $8,000 worth of marijuana.  The only motive disclosed by investigators was that DiNardo said he wanted to set the victims up when they went to the farm to buy marijuana.  In a statement given to reporters after Sunday night's vigil, Patrick's grandparents, Sharon and Rich Patrick, thanked investigators "who worked so long and hard to bring our boys home."
