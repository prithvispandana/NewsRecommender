A survivor of gang rape in India has been attacked with acid for the fifth time as she was taking shelter in a women’s refuge, but police have disputed her account. A woman who was allegedly raped by more than one man in 2008 following an argument over property then suffered five separate acid attacks, mostly from the same perpetrators.
