A Conservative MP and doctor has attacked huge NHS cuts in England, while similar sums are handed out in Northern Ireland to prop up Theresa May in power. Sarah Wollaston warned the health service in England was being forced into “draconian measures” that would damage both public health and patient safety. Embarrassingly for No 10, Dr Wollaston linked the cuts directly to the £1bn deal signed with the Democratic Unionist Party to deliver the Conservatives a majority in the Commons.
