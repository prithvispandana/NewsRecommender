HILO, Hawaii (AP) â€” A Hawaii father, mother and grandmother are charged with murder after allegedly starving a 9-year-old girl. Police on Hawaii's Big Island on Friday arrested 49-year-old Kevin Lehano (leh-hah-noh), 33-year-old Tiffany Stone and 59-year-old Henrietta Stone. Hawaii County Prosecuting Attorney Mitch Roth, reading from a grand jury indictment, says they are accused of denying the girl food, water and medical treatment for about a year before she died in June 2016.
