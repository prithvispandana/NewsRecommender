The former head of the Vote Leave campaign has branded the Brexit Secretary as “thick as mine” and “as lazy as a toad”. Dominic Cummings, who is also a former top advisor to Mr Gove, said David Davis’s Repeal Bill contained provisions that would allow ministers to cave in to EU demands at the last minute. Mr Cummings’ outburst reflects continuing disagreement between different wings of the Brexit movement, which saw intense infighting at the time of last year's EU referendum.
