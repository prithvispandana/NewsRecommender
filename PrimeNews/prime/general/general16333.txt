Theresa May hinted she is poised to sack disloyal ministers, when she said she was keeping her rebellious Cabinet in place “at the moment”. The Prime Minister told a radio interview there is “no such thing as an unsackable minister”, suggesting she is about to punish colleagues who have angered her. "At the moment the team is together and we’re getting on with the job of delivering what we believe the British people want us to do,” she said.
