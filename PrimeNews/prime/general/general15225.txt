NEW YORK (AP) â€” It was a far cry from "The buck stops here." President Donald Trump, dealt a stinging defeat with the failure of the Republican health care bill in the Senate, flipped the script from Harry Truman's famous declaration of presidential responsibility and declared Tuesday, "I am not going to own it." He had tweeted earlier, "We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans." This is the same president who thundered night after night on the campaign trail that it would be "so easy" to repeal and replace the Obama health care law on Day One of his administration.
