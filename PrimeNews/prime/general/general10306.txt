LONDON (AP) — Much has changed for Roger Federer since he played in, and won, his first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon in 2003. First of all, as he reminded everyone after moving into his 11th title match at the All England Club — with a shot at his eighth championship, more than any man in history — he favored a ponytail and some scruff on his cheeks way back then. Nowadays, his hair is short, his face clean shaven. Another significant difference for Federer, whose 36th birthday is Aug. 8, making him the oldest men's finalist at Wimbledon since 1974?
