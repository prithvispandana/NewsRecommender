A woman has caused $200,000 (Â£152,000) worth of damage at a US exhibit after knocking over a display while taking a selfie. The incident took place at The 14th Factory exhibit at a gallery in Los Angeles, California and was captured on security cameras with the video later being shared to LiveLeak. In the clip, the unlucky woman can be seen losing her balance as she attempts to take a selfie in front of a row of sculptures placed on pedestals. Knocking one over, it creates a domino effect knocking over another ten sending the sculptures crashing to the ground.
