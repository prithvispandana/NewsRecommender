Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has claimed Germany is "committing suicide" by not allowing him to speak to Turks at a rally in Germany. "Germany needs to correct this mistake," he told the Die Zeit newspaper, adding that "We need each other". Germany has blocked Mr Erdogan from making a speech to supporters during the G20 summit in Hamburg later this week, which could have drawn huge protests from Kurds living in Germany.
