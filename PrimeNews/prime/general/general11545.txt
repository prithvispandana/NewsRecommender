Donald Trump reportedly told Theresa May he will not make a state visit to the UK until he is guaranteed a "better reception". The US President asked the Prime Minister to prepare a "warm welcome" before he agrees to set a date, it has been claimed.  The pair spoke on the phone to discuss the planned state visit, which has now been postponed until next year.
