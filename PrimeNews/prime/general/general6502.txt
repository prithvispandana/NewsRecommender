RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) â€” Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was convicted of corruption and money laundering on Wednesday and sentenced to nine and a half years in jail. Silva will remain free while an appeal is heard. Silva was accused of receiving a beachfront apartment as a kickback from construction company OAS. Prosecutors also alleged OAS did repairs to the apartment and paid to store Silva's belongings. The former president has said the charges are completely unfounded. The case is part of a massive corruption investigation that has roiled Brazilian politics that has seen business executives and elite politicians jailed.
