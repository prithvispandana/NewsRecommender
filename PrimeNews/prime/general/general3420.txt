LONDON (AP) — Based on Andy Murray's body language alone, reporters' questions can produce an inordinate amount of consternation. He'll puff his cheeks, then let out a sigh. He'll rub his forehead, then clutch his chin. When answers do arrive, some are preceded by a hesitant "Ummm." Others begin with "No" or "I wouldn't have thought so" — or both. "I don't know" is a popular refrain. Truth is, given all that is going on at the moment, the No. 1-seeded Murray could be forgiven for having a lot on his mind as he prepares to start his title defense at the All England Club on Monday.
