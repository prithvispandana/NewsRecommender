The Education Secretary has announced an extra £1.3 billion in funding of schools in England over two years – to be raised by cuts elsewhere in the wider education budget. Justine Greening said the money, which amounts to around £650m a year, would be rolled out at the same time as a new funding formula for schools. The minister argued that the new schools funding formula, to be introduced next year, would replace a current funding system that was "unfair, opaque and out of date".
