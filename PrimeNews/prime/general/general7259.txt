LONDON (AP) â€” Chants of "Roger! Roger! Roger!" filled the early evening air at the All England Club, so after his post-match stretch, Roger Federer paused on a bridge connected to Centre Court and waved to his adoring public. "When you see that they're there for you, it's a bit of an unusual feeling. I'm very touched, actually, to have so much support," Federer said. "I never would have imagined when I was younger that I would have experienced this."
