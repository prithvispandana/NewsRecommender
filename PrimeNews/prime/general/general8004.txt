The Scottish and Welsh First Ministers have voted to block legislative consent for the Government’s Brexit Repeal Bill – throwing a spanner in the works of Theresa May’s plan to leave the EU. Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones said the bill was a “naked power grab” by Westminster because it did not immediately return powers to the devolved administrations after taking them from the EU. The Brexit Repeal Bill moves all EU law into the UK government statue books – freezing it during the Brexit process so that it can be changed piecemeal once Britain has left the bloc.
