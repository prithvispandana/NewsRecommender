In the halls of the US capitol, many Republicans are keeping a cool demeanour when asked if they are concerned with emails released by Donald Trump Jr that show him facilitating a meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer who said she had dirt on Hillary Clinton. The White House, similarly, has swatted away concerns publicly. Mr Trump Jr did not do anything wrong, they said hours after the emails were released. He’s simply being transparent. He’s a high-quality person.
