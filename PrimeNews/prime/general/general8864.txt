At least 15 Conservative MPs are in talks with a Labour MP to prevent a hard Brexit – potentially enough to defeat Theresa May in the Commons. Stephen Kinnock said there was a “growing recognition” of the need for Britain to embrace a Norway-style arrangement to head off the threat of severe economic damage. The MP said he was seeking support for Britain remaining within the European Economic Area (EEA) after Brexit and, therefore, the EU single market – at least for a period of time.
