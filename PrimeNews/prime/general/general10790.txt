Workers at a building site in Quebec posed next to a centuries-old cannonball without realising it was full of live gunpowder which would explode on impact.Â  The weapon, believed to have been fired by the British during a siege in 1759, was unearthed during excavation work. It would have been designed to set fire to the building it landed against, with the powder igniting once the ball broke. The workers took four photos with the 90kg (200lb) rusted ball.
