The damaging NHS pay cap can be lifted without costing the Government any significant money, a Conservative MP and practising doctor says. Dr Dan Poulter has put forward a plan to persuade Theresa May to ease the pressure on health service staff, by recognising the current calculations of the cost of a pay rise are fatally flawed. Unless there is an urgent rethink to ensure doctors, nurses and other staff are “properly rewarded”, they will flee the NHS in growing numbers, he told The Independent.
