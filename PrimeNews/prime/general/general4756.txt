US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has said America is prepared to use military force against North Korea in the wake of its latest missile test. Ms Haley said the test, of an intercontinental ballistic missile possibly capable of hitting Alaska, was "reckless and irresponsible, and made the world a more dangerous place". She added that the US is prepared to use its full range of capabilities – including military force – to deter North Korea if necessary.
