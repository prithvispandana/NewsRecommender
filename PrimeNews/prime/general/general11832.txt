A teenage boy who grew up in the slums of Nairobi has been awarded a place at the English National Ballet School in London. Joel Kioko, widely seen as Kenya’s most promising ballet dancer, has been awarded a full scholarship for the prestigious school despite having never seen a full-length ballet on the stage. The 17-year-old was raised in Nairobi’s Kuwinda slum and took his first ever dance class in a school classroom with stripped bare walls and no barre or mirror.
