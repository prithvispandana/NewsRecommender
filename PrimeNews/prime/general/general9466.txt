The Government's latest policy relaunch aimed at tacklingÂ illegal drugs amid soaring death rates has been heavily criticised by campaigners who say it fails to get to grips with the problem. The UK Drug Strategy 2017 was announced by the Home Office as its flagship initiative to reduce use of illicit substances and improve addiction recovery rates. Drug misuse has been falling in recent years, figures show. Some 2.7 million 16- to 59-year-olds in England and Wales took illegal drugs in 2015/16, down from 10.5% a decade ago.
