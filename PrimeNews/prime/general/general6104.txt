Crazy Kazakhs, unpredictable Germans, flamboyant Italians, eccentric Frenchmen – they are all the same to Andy Murray. The world No 1 has faced an exotic mix of some of the game’s more charismatic figures in his first four matches here and come through each of them with a minimum of fuss. Benoit Paire was the latest showman to be swept off the Centre Court stage as Murray won 7-6, 6-4, 6-4 to secure his 26th win in a row against Frenchmen in tour-level matches and his 28th in succession against them in Grand Slam competition.
