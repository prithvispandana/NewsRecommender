The tears of a teenager who lived in a block neighbouring Grenfell Tower reduced a senior member of the local council to silence during a tense public meeting. The 17-year-old, who gave her name as Rhianna, said the trauma of the fire had sent her backwards in her long-term struggle with depression. She said she had been forced to seek counselling proactively and recalled how her eight-year-old nephew was suffering after finding out his teacher had been one of those who perished in the blaze.
