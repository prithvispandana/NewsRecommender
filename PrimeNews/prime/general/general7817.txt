Disturbing footage has emerged of a police dog clamping down on a handcuffed black man's arm and refusing to let go.   Despite the suspect being subdued, the creature continues to lock its teeth on his arm.  He can be heard screaming "uncomfortable" as an officer tries to unlatch the police dog's jaw. Two other officers hold down the man’s legs.  He was left with an open wound on his arm.
