WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Donald Trump said Sunday that "it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia" after his lengthy meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Germany. But he is still avoiding the question of whether he accepts Putin's denial that Russia was responsible for meddling in the 2016 election. Speaking in a series of early morning tweets after returning the night before from a world leaders' summit in Germany, Trump said that he "strongly pressed" Putin twice over Russian meddling during their lengthy meeting Friday.
