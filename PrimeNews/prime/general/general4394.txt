New minister Steve Baker has slapped down colleagues trying to avert a hard Brexit, insisting there will be no compromise on Theresa May’s plans. It would be fatal show of weakness – “like putting blood in the water” – to let Brussels believe Britain is stepping back from the Prime Minister’s hardline proposals, set out in January, he warned. Mr Baker admitted to Cabinet divisions on the terms of Brexit since the election weakened Ms May, saying: “It is the case that some people would like to reinvent things.”
