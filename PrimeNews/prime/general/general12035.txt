INDIANAPOLIS (AP) â€” An Indiana woman didn't want her canceled $30,000 wedding to go to waste, so she threw a dinner party for the homeless. A bus pulled up to the swanky event center on Saturday that Sarah Cummins had booked for the reception in Carmel, a suburb north of Indianapolis. About a dozen veterans from a local organization were among the guests who dined on bourbon-glazed meatballs, roasted garlic bruschetta and wedding cake.
