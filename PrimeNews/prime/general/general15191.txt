A Muslim girl has refused to join a teacher training institute under Jamia Nadwiya at Edavanna in Malappuram after the institution insisted that she could not wear purdah on all days while attending the class. Husna C, wife of Muhammad Harshad P, decided not to pursue the course after institute authorities rejected her plea to wear purdah instead of sari.
