ISTANBUL (AP) — Activists for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex rights said they will march for LGBT pride in Istanbul on Sunday, despite a ban by the governor. Organizers of the 2017 Istanbul LGBTI Pride called for the gathering to begin at 5 p.m. (14:00 GMT) in central Taksim Square, using a Turkish hashtag for "we march." The Istanbul governor's office on Saturday banned the event — for the third year in a row — citing reasons of safety and public order. The statement also said the governor's office had not received a valid parade application, a claim rejected by organizers.
