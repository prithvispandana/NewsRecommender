Greek authorities said a group of about 10 men killed an American tourist during a bar fight early Friday morning on a Greek island, state news agency ANA-MPA reported.  The confrontation quickly escalated to a fistfight, and the bar's security guard asked the two to leave, according to the state news agency.  Eight people have been arrested and will be charged in connection to Henderson's death, the news agency reported.  The news agency reported that the six were recognized from surveillance videos.  A State Department official said in a statement that Greek police have notified the U.S. Embassy of Henderson's death.  U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said Friday night that he's in touch with State Department officials to make sure Henderson's friends get home safely.  Zakynthos, the third-largest island in the Ionian Sea, is known for its nightlife, picturesque views, crystal-clear beaches and limestone cliffs.
