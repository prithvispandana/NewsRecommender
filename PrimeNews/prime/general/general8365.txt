Taxpayers received “value for money” from the sale of Government-owned RBS shares in 2015, despite making a loss of close to £2bn, according to an official watchdog. The National Audit Office revealed on Friday that the losses from the sale of the 5.4 per cent stake hit £1.9bn, significantly more than the £1.1bn previously thought. It confirmed that details of the impending sale were leaked to the market an hour before it was officially announced.
