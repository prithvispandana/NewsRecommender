CHICAGO (AP) â€” An Illinois sheriff's office said Wednesday that it has identified a Minnesota runaway as one of the victims of serial killer John Wayne Gacy. In a news release, the Cook County Sheriff's Department said that the remains of a person whose body was found under the crawl space of Gacy's Chicago area home in 1978 were those of 16-year-old James "Jimmie" Byron Haakenson. The teenager had left his home in 1976 and was last heard from in August of that year when he called his mother and told her he was in Chicago.
