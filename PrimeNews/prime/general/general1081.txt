NEW YORK (AP) â€” Time to pick players for the All-Star Game and make those close calls. Yankees rookie Aaron Judge and Washington slugger Bryce Harper are among the big names who have undoubtedly secured their spots in Miami on July 11. But there's a logjam at the corners in the National League, and both rosters are smaller now that the Midsummer Classic no longer determines where the World Series begins. "I'm OK with this," Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "When you're combining the attempt to play everybody and win the game for the sake of the National League so you get home-field advantage, there's a lot going on."
