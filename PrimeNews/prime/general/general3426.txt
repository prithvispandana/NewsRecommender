As tennis turns to Wimbledon, there's been a bit of a throwback feel to this Grand Slam season so far. At the year's first major tournament, the Australian Open in January, Roger Federer beat Rafael Nadal for the men's title, and Serena Williams defeated her sister, Venus, for the women's title. Matchups from a decade ago or more, right? Then, at the French Open in May and June, Nadal reached a second consecutive major final for the first time since 2014, and won one for the first time since that year.
