Survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire and those living within the shadow of the charred block held a silent walk around the scene of the tragedy to honour those who were killed in the fatal blaze.  The event, which was held away from cameras, gave residents a chance to come together and pay their respects.  It was organised by Grenfell United, a collective created for those who fled the inferno in West London.
