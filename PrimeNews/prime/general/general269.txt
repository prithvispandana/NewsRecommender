The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has said 57 people are thought to have been killed in an US-led air strike in an eastern Syrian town controlled by Isis. The UK-based war monitor said the air strike took place on Monday at dawn, hitting a building in al-Mayadeen used to house dissenters against Isis' rule. At least 15 Isis fighters and jailers were reported among the dead in the attack in Deir Ezzour province.
