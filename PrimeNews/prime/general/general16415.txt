LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Discovery Channel wants Shark Week viewers to be donors as well. The channel's annual celebration of all things shark will include requests to support Oceana, an advocacy group focused on ocean conservation. Viewers can use their smartphones to donate and also to receive Shark Week program information, said technology company Pledgeling, which is working with Discovery on the Oceana fundraising. By texting the word "SHARK" to 707070, participants will get a return message that includes a Pledgeling link for Oceana donations that can be made by Apple Pay or by credit card.
