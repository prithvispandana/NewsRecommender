Record numbers of teachers are being banned from the classroom for sexual misconduct, The Independent can reveal. A third of teachers struck off last year were involved in sex-related cases, and in the highest numbers for three years, according to exclusive new figures. More were banned for sexual misconduct last year alone, than were forced out of the profession because of alcohol, drugs or violence in total during the last five years.
