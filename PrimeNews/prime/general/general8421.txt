It has never been deadlier to stand up against corporations that destroy the environment.  A record number of 200 environmental activists were killed in 2016 while protesting against companies' mining, logging and agribusiness activities, a report by Global Witness has found.  The NGO which exposes corruption and environmental abuse has been tracking the number of people killed defending their land from destructive activities and in the last few years has consecutively reported a record number of deaths.
