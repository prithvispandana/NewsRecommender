The CBI had recently registered a case against Dutta for allegedly entering into criminal conspiracy with three other I-T officials and several Kolkata-based businessmen. As part of the deal, Dutta would allegedly accept hefty bribe from the businessmen through a chartered accountant to get the I-T assessment files of different assessees transferred from Kolkata/Hazaribagh to Ranchi, CBI sources said.
