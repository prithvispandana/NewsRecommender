Rumours of the Lions' demise have been greatly exaggerated. What unfolded in Wellington on Saturday was one of the great British and Irish Lions victories of all time, and in a 24-21 victory that was littered with ill-discipline, red and yellow cards and two tries for the tourists, the series will head back to Auckland for an almighty deciding showdown. Sonny Bill Williams will be remembered as the villain; his first-half red card leaving his side in huge trouble, and yet the Lions still nearly found a way to lose the second Test at the Westpac Stadium.
