WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Latest on the Republican effort to repeal the Obama health law (all times EDT): 7 p.m. U.S. Capitol Police say they've arrested around 155 demonstrators in Senate office buildings as Republicans continue working on legislation to eliminate much of President Barack Obama's health care law. Arrests of demonstrators opposing the GOP effort have been occurring frequently. Wednesday's figure was among the largest since the demonstrations began. The police say they responded at 45 different spots in the three Senate office buildings beginning in midafternoon. They say the arrests were made after requests to stop demonstrating were ignored. Under the District of Columbia's laws, it is illegal to demonstrate in the buildings of the Capitol complex. Those arrested were charged with obstructing public spaces, a misdemeanor. Police say four people were also charged with resisting arrest
