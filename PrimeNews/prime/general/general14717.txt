LONDON (AP) â€” Actor Daniel Radcliffe has come to the aid of a man who was mugged by moped-riding attackers in London. Former police officer David Videcette told the Evening Standard newspaper that two moped riders attacked a man just off the upmarket King's Road in west London, slashing him across the face and making off with a Louis Vuitton bag. He said he saw 27-year-old Radcliffe consoling the victim after the attack.
