Film director Madhur Bhandarkar had to cancel his press conference organised to promote his film Indu Sarkar on Saturday, after Congress demanded a clarification regarding Bhandarkar’s stand on the film. The film – which is to be released on July 28 – is set in the backdrop of the Emergency of 1975 and Congress workers were opposing its release.
