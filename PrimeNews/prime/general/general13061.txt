A man accused of hitting a Muslim woman and trying to pull off her headscarf has denied the attack, claiming he was trying to protect his girlfriend from racist abuse. Aniso Abdulkadir said she was waiting for a tube at Baker Street Station in the early hours of Saturday morning when a man attacked her. She claimed her friend was also pinned against a wall and spat at.
