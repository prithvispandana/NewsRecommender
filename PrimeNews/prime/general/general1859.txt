NEW YORK (AP) — The Latest on a shooting at Bronx Lebanon Hospital (all times local): 5:40 p.m. New York City's mayor says one doctor is dead and several others are fighting for their lives after a gunman opened fire at a city hospital. Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke at a news conference Friday, hours after a doctor with a rifle concealed in his lab coat started shooting inside Bronx Lebanon Hospital. Police say five of the injured were seriously wounded, and one had a gunshot wound to the leg. Police Commissioner James O'Neill says the shooter then apparently tried to set himself on fire before turning the gun on himself. A law enforcement official identified the shooter as Dr. Henry Bello, who used to work at the hospital. — By Associated Press writer Colleen Long
