A former senior Metropolitan Police officer has called for stronger measures to be used against criminals who operate on mopeds, even if it results in their deaths. David Videcette, who investigated organised crime with Scotland Yard, said the "overzealous" enforcement of current guidelines were impeding police from tackling the moped crime wave which has gripped London.
