Iraq’s state television has said the country’s prime minister has arrived in Mosul to declare victory over Isis there after an eight-month battle to drive Isis fighters from the city. Haider al-Abadi, dressed in a military uniform, said he “congratulates the fighters and the people on the big victory” in Mosul.   Militants were still being “chased” in some areas of the city, however, according to Iraqi TV. The leader was seen disembarking from a military plane and met by senior security forces commanders.
