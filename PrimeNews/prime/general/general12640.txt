LOUTOLIM, India (AP) â€” Age sits lightly on the sprawling, 4-centuries-old Figueiredo Mansion. The home is a lived-in repository of memories tracing to the days when the west-coast Indian state of Goa was a Portuguese colony. The Figueiredo family of Portuguese diplomats, lawyers and parliamentarians began building the mansion in 1590 as they made their home in quaint Loutolim, surrounded by paddy fields and a few neighbors. The family added a second section with similar design to the home 200 years later.
