PHILADELPHIA (AP) â€” Two cousins charged in a gruesome crime spree that ended with police unearthing the bodies of four young men buried on a family farm started off committing small crimes. But authorities don't know why the 20-year-old suspects escalated from offenses like break-ins and jewelry heists to allegedly killing their victims and burying them in two pits so deep beneath the ground that a backhoe and dozens of people were needed to sift through the dirt. Police found the missing men after a grueling, five-day search in sweltering heat and pelting rain.
