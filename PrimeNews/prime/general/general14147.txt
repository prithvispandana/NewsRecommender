ISTANBUL (AP) — A court in Istanbul ordered six human rights activists — including Amnesty International's Turkey director — formally arrested Tuesday pending a trial over accusations that they aided an armed terror group, adding to concerns over human rights in the country. Four others activists were released from custody pending the outcome of a trial. They have been barred from traveling abroad and have to report regularly to police. The group was detained earlier this month in a police raid at a hotel on Buyukada island while attending a training workshop on digital security.
