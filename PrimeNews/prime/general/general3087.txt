TRENTON, N.J. (AP) â€” The Latest on New Jersey's budget stalemate (all times local): 8:20 a.m. Gov. Chris Christie is defending his use of a beach closed to the public during New Jersey's government shutdown, saying he had previously announced his vacation plans and the media had simply "caught a politician keeping his word." The Republican governor was photographed Sunday by NJ.com at Island Beach State Park sitting on a beach chair in sandals and a T-shirt before flying to talk to reporters in Trenton. Christie tells WTXF-TV in Philadelphia on Monday that he had earlier said he planned to be at the state-owned governor's beach house regardless of whether there was a shutdown. He says the media "caught a politician keeping his word" and adds New Jersey "has beaches for 120 miles" so there are plenty of options for anyone wanting a beach day as the Fourth of July approaches.
