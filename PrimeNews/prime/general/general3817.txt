WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Donald Trump criticized North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after that country's latest missile launch, asking, "Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?" Trump wrote on Twitter late Monday that it's "Hard to believe that South Korea ... and Japan will put up with this much longer." And he urged North Korea's biggest ally, China, to "put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!" South Korean officials said early Tuesday that North Korea had launched another ballistic missile toward Japan, part of a string of recent test-firings as the North works to build a nuclear-tipped missile that could reach the United States.
