Trade Secretary Liam Fox has insisted Britain must be free to sign deals with non-EU countries from day one after Brexit, potentially opening up another Cabinet split. Dr Fox laid down his own red line by saying he would not accept a transitional deal to delay full EU withdrawal if it held back the trading “opportunities” on offer across the globe. He also condemned Cabinet leaks which have targeted Philip Hammond – an attempt, the Chancellor has claimed, to undermine his soft Brexit policy.
