Charlie Gard's mother has spoken out ahead of the latest High Court hearing in the tragic saga surrounding her terminally-ill son. Judge Nicholas Francis will hear new arguments around whether Connie Yates and Charlie's father, Chris Gard, should be allowed to take their son out of hospital to receive experimental treatment elsewhere. He ruled earlier this year that the nucleoside treatment, which has never been tested on a person or even a mouse with Charlie's particular genetic illness, would be "futile".
