A video showing a man being beaten by Venezuelan authorities has emerged amid UN denunciation of police brutality in the country. Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado tweeted the video out to her 3.7 million followers with the caption “All the brutality of the tyranny collapses when faced with the dignity of just one man.” The video is reported to have been filmed on Thursday in the northern city of Lechería, and shows members of the Venezuelan national guard beating what appears to be a passer-by.
