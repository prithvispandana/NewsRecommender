SALT LAKE CITY (AP) â€” A trendy downtown Salt Lake City seafood restaurant started business Saturday with glass-smashing and champagne, a symbolic gesture in its emancipation from Utah's so-called "Zion Curtains" alcohol law. "It feels fabulous and liberating. It's a hallelujah moment," said Joel LaSalle, owner of Current Fish &amp; Oyster. "It'll make our restaurant twice as beautiful because you can actually see the $100,000 bar and wall." The new liquor law went into effect Saturday, making wine, liquor and higher-alcohol beer more expensive while also allowing some restaurants to take down walls and partitions that were meant to prevent customers from seeing their alcoholic drinks being mixed and poured.
