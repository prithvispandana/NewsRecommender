WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Donald Trump was captured complimenting the French president's wife's appearance Thursday as he toured a famous Paris landmark. Video footage posted on the French government's official Facebook page showed Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron and their wives chatting after their tour of the museums at Les Invalides. As they were saying their good-byes, Trump turned to Brigitte Macron and gestured toward her body. "You know, you're in such good shape," Trump said, before repeating the observation to her husband. "Beautiful," he added.
