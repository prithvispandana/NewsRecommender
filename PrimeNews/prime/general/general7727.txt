KENT, Ohio (AP) — Metin Eren wasn't satisfied just digging up ancient arrowheads to learn about the past. He wanted to use them for their intended purpose. But shooting and shattering priceless millennia-old tips is out of the question, so instead, the archaeologist chips replicas of the stone-age weapons by hand. "We can break 'em and throw 'em," he says. "Our imagination is the limit." The 34-year-old Kent State University professor specializes in experimental archaeology — re-creating ancient pots, knives and arrows. By testing the replicas in ways impossible with the originals, archaeologists study how tools found in archaeological digs were actually used.
