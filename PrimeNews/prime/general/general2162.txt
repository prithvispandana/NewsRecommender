NEW YORK (AP) — In his 4½ years as a state senator from Manhattan, Brad Holyman has handed out everything from flashlights to T-shirts at political rallies. But for a gathering held soon after President Donald Trump's inauguration, he decided on something more substantial: Copies of the Constitution. "My constituents had been asking me, 'What can I do to help?' 'How do I prepare myself?'" says Holyman, a Democrat in his third term who has since distributed thousands of copies. "A year ago, who would have imagined that giving away the Constitution would be seen as an act of resistance?"
