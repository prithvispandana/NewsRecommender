Anti-globalisation protesters involved in a third consecutive night of clashes with police in Hamburg are ‘crazy’, according to some refugees in the city. Police used water cannon trucks against rioters, who hurled iron rods and pavement blocks at authorities, even after G20 leaders had left the city. “If people did this in Egypt they would be shot,” said Ibrahim Ali, a 29-year-old Egyptian who came to Hamburg in 2011.
