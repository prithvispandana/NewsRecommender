Donald Trump has complimented Brigitte Macron’s body in front of her husband, saying she looks "great". After a tour of the museums at Les Invalides in Paris, as Mr Trump and Emmanuel Macron prepared to say “bon voyage” to their wives, Mr Trump turned to Ms Macron. The exchange was captured on a live stream of the tour provided by the French government. “You’re in such great shape,” Mr Trump told her. He then turned to her husband Emmanuel.
