NEW YORK (AP) â€” A ticking sound runs throughout "Dunkirk" like an omnipresent reminder that time is running out for the 340,000 British and Allied soldiers marooned on the French beach and surrounded by Germans. It's a tick-tock effect woven into the score that originated, fittingly, from Christopher Nolan's own stopwatch. Nolan is cinema's great watchmaker: a filmmaker of Swiss precision capable of bending and shaping time to suit his grandiose, metronomed movies. Having already reversed time ("Memento") and warped its fabric ("Interstellar"), Nolan set out to accomplish something different with "Dunkirk," a movie that crosscuts three story lines (on land, sea and sky) from three different chronologies (one week, one day, one hour) during the famous evacuation.
