A total of 181 cladding samples on high rise towers across England have failed fire safety tests, Sajid Javid has announced. The communities secretary revealed the updated number in Parliament and it is expected to rise as more buildings are tested. "So far all 181 samples of cladding tested have failed - the priority now is to make those buildings safe," he said.
