A viscount who offered money to people who killed a Brexit campaigner has been jailed. Aristocrat Rhodri Phillips, who is the the 4th Viscount St Davids, was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison after posting threatening and racist messages about Gina Miller. Ms Miller had brought a case to the High Court that argued MPs needed to vote on whether Britain triggered Article 50.
