The Italian mafia has been accused of starting the major wildfires that have spread across the slopes of Mount Vesuvius near Naples, leading to scores of evacuations. The burned corpses of cats have been found at the scene, according to Italian media reports, leading to speculation that arsonists may be involved. The mafia has previously been found to have used the animals to start fires, pouring petrol on them before setting them alight in order to spread fire throughout the undergrowth.
