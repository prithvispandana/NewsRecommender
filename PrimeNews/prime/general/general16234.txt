The BBC’s top stars have spoken out after the corporation published a list of 214 staff who earn more than £150,000.  Radio 2 presenter Jeremy Vine’s reaction prompted confusion after he asked radio director James Purnell why he earned so much.  Mr Vine is the corporation's fourth highest earner, taking home an estimated £750,000.
