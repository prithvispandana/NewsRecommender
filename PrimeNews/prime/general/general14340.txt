WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Around the time Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya met with President Donald Trump's oldest son last year, she was drawing attention from U.S. government officials for her work with an investment firm attempting to weaken U.S. sanctions on Russia. Officials tried to seize the attorney's emails and at times denied her entry into the U.S., according to government and legal documents.
