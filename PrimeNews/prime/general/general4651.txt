NEW YORK (AP) â€” A weird thing happened when the four members of the alt-rock band Imagine Dragons sat down to listen to their new album all the way through. They actually liked it. "This was the first record that I think after we created it and we listened to it, we all went, for the first time, 'Yes. This is Imagine Dragons and we're proud of this,'" said lead singer Dan Reynolds. "That doesn't happen very often in this band, to be honest with you."
