The leader of Isis’ Afghanistan branch has been killed by a US air strike, according to the Pentagon. Abu Sayed, was killed in an air strike on the group's headquarters in Kunar province earlier this week, Pentagon spokeswomen Dana White said in a statement. Tuesday's raid also killed other members of Isis and would "significantly disrupt the terror group's plans to expand its presence in Afghanistan," the statement added.
