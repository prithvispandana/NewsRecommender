LONDON (AP) â€” Britain's foreign secretary has backed U.K. court decisions preventing the parents of a terminally ill child from taking him abroad for experimental treatment, despite an offer of help from a Vatican hospital. Boris Johnson's comment Wednesday came during a previously scheduled call in which Italy's foreign minister raised the hospital's offer to treat 11-month-old Charlie Gard, who is suffering from a rare genetic condition that has damaged his brain and left him unable to breathe without assistance.
