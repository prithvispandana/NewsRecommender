Angry backbench Conservative MPs have hit out at Theresa May over her extraordinary appeal to Labour and other parties to help her govern. Desmond Swayne, a former minister, criticised “this new lovefest with the benches opposite” – urging the Prime Minister to approach Jeremy Corbyn with “a very long spoon”. And Edward Leigh, a senior backbencher, called on her to listen to ideas put forward by fellow Conservatives, not to “useless Socialist” proposals.
