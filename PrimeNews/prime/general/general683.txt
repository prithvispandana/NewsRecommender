PRESCOTT VALLEY, Ariz. (AP) â€” After spending two nights in a shelter for people evacuated from a raging Arizona wildfire, Tracey McCabe was looking forward Thursday to sleeping in her own bed after authorities lifted some evacuation orders and said improving weather conditions were helping them fight the fire. McCabe was among several hundred residents in the town of Mayer, population 1,400, allowed to return home after fire officials determined their homes were no longer at risk from a blaze that started Saturday and has burned 39 square miles (101 square kilometers).
