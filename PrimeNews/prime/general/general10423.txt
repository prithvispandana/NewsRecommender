Theresa May didn't want to wear the £995 pair of designer trousers that sparked a PR disaster known as "Trousergate", but was talked into it by one of her senior aides, according to the Prime Minister's former spin doctor. Ms May planned to wear her own clothes for a Sunday Times photoshoot at her Downing Street flat in November 2016, but was persuaded to get into the leather Amanda Wakeley trousers by her then joint chief of staff Fiona Hill, it is said.
