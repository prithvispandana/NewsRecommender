MPs have said they are living in “genuine fear” after they received death threats and abuse during the general election campaign.   Theresa May has ordered a No 10 policy unit review into the issue, inviting MPs to share details of their experiences as “evidence gathering”. Cabinet held a discussion earlier this week about intimidating electoral practises after the issue was raised by Andrea Leadsom, leader of the House of Commons.
