A nurse says she is facing paying around £150,000 in charges to a private company for parking at the hospital where she works after she and colleagues lost a court ruling. The unnamed nurse is just one of 75 members of staff at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff who lost a court battle against Indigo Park Services which manages car parks on the site.
