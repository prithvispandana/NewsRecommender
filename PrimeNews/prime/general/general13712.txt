The Queen's Swan Marker David Barber holds a swan before it is released back onto the river during the annual Swan Upping census July 17, 2017 on the River Thames, South West London. The historic Swan Upping ceremony dates back to the 12th century, to when the Crown claimed ownership of all Mute Swans and they were eaten at banquets and feasts. The Sovereign's Swan Marker, David Barber, counts the number of young cygnets on the river each year and ensures that the swan population is maintained. The swans and young cygnets are also assessed for any signs of injury or disease.
