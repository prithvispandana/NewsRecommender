Ukraine is in talks with one of France’s biggest energy businesses to construct a $1.25bn (£969m) solar facility at the derelict Chernobyl nuclear reactor plant and its surrounding area. Ostap Semerak, Ukraine’s minister of ecology said that Engie is starting a pre-feasibility survey bankrolled by the French government next week. The results should be published by the end of 2017.
