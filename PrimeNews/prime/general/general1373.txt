Far-right French leader Marine Le Pen has been charged by police over the misappropriation of European Parliament funds, her lawyer has said.  Ms Le Pen is facing allegations her party the Front National (FN) claimed millions of euros from the European Parliament to pay for France-based staff.  The prosecutor's office said she was handed preliminary charges of breach of trust and complicity in breach of trust concerning two of her aides when she served at the European Parliament.
