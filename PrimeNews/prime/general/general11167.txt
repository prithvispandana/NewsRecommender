PHOENIX (AP) â€” Surgeons in Phoenix say they removed a blood clot from above the left eye of Sen. John McCain. Mayo Clinic Hospital doctors said Saturday that McCain underwent a "minimally invasive" procedure to remove the nearly 2-inch (5-centimeter) clot, and that the surgery went "very well." They said the 80-year-old Republican is resting comfortably at his home in Arizona. Pathology reports are expected in the next several days. McCain's office said in a statement that on the advice of his doctors, the senator will be recovering in Arizona next week.
