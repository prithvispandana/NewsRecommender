LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) â€” A rapper whose concert in Little Rock was the site of a shooting that left 28 people injured has been arrested on unrelated assault charges outside an Alabama club where he was performing just 24 hours later, and authorities said several firearms were recovered during the arrest. Ricky Hampton, 25, of Memphis, Tennessee, also known as Finese 2Tymes, was arrested early Sunday on outstanding charges of aggravated assault with a gun out of Forrest City in eastern Arkansas, the U.S. Marshals Service said. A second man also was taken into custody, and two handguns and an assault rifle were seized from the Mercedes in which the two men were riding, said Cliff LaBarge with the U.S. Marshals Service in Alabama.
