Philip Hammond has laid bare Cabinet infighting over Brexit, suggesting other ministers are out to get him because he is pushing for Theresa May to change course. The Chancellor said damaging stories about him were coming from “people who are not happy with the agenda that I have”, which is to steer Britain towards a transitional exit deal. The claim came as Mr Hammond all-but admitted he had told the Cabinet that public sector workers are “overpaid” – while denying he said “even a woman” can drive a train.
