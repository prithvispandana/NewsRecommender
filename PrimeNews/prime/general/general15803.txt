Water was thrown over two women standing outside a mosque in an apparent fake acid attackÂ police are treating as racially aggravated assault. The women, who were wearing traditional head coverings, were attacked as they waited outside the Bashir Ahmed Masjid in Southampton on Tuesday. CCTV footage shows a black car slowing down next to them before speeding away. The pair react in horror before realising they are unhurt.
