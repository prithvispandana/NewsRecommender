HONOLULU (AP) â€” At least three people died in a fire that broke out on the 26th floor of a Honolulu high-rise Friday and hundreds fled as smoke billowed from the upper floors of the giant apartment complex. The blaze at the Marco Polo apartments spread from the 26th floor to at least the 28th floor and hit several units, said Honolulu Fire Department spokesman Capt. David Jenkins. The three dead were found on the 26th floor, said Fire Chief Manuel Neves. Firefighters say there were reports of people trapped in their units in the burning building and some residents were unaccounted for.
