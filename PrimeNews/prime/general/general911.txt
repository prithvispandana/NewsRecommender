BEIJING (AP) â€” China on Friday strongly protested a U.S. plan to sell $1.4 billion worth of arms to Taiwan and demanded that the deal be canceled. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the sale would severely damage China's sovereignty and security interests and run counter to Washington's commitment to a "one-China" policy. He asked the U.S. to immediately stop the sale to avoid harming relations with Beijing. "We stress that nobody could sway our determination to uphold our territorial integrity and sovereignty," Lu said at a regular daily briefing. "We oppose any external interference in our internal affairs."
