PARIS (AP) â€” French President Emmanuel Macron denounced France's collaboration in the Holocaust, lashing out Sunday at those who negate or minimize the country's role in sending tens of thousands of Jews to their deaths. After he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a Holocaust commemoration, Macron also appealed for renewed Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Worried that Netanyahu is backing away from commitment to a two-state solution, Macron assailed Jewish settlement construction as a threat to international hopes for peace.
