The union representing thousands of low-paid production workers employed by the BBC has called for a minimum salary of £20,000. Bectu – the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union - said it was "unjustifiable" for the corporation to focus on the earnings of those on more than £150,000 when thousands of engineers, technical and other production staff were paid a fraction of that amount. Around 2,500 staff at the publicly-funded broadcaster are understood to earn less than £20,000.
