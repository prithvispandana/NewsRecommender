Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire has confirmed that no power-sharing deal has been reached in Northern Ireland. Thursday's deadline had been extended to 4pm today. Mr Brokenshire said “progress had been made” between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party and that a deal “remains achievable” but warned that “time is running out”. Mr Brokenshire said that since the election in March, “civil servants not politicians have been making decisions in Northern Ireland” – a hiatus he said could not continue indefinitely.
