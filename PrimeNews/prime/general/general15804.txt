The Government has won its High Court bid to obtain a permanent ban on industrial action by prison officers. The Ministry of Justice's application follows a move in February by the Prison Officers Association (POA) to call on its members to take action short of a strike. This led to a judge granting an interim injunction requiring the POA to withdraw instructions to members to refuse to undertake certain voluntary tasks.
