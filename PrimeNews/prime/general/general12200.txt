WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A robotics team comprised of six girls from Afghanistan will enter a robot in an international competition in Washington, after clearing visa obstacles that prompted intervention from President Donald Trump. The opening ceremony for the three-day high school competition is scheduled for Sunday evening. They will be competing against entrants from more than 150 countries in the FIRST Global Challenge. It's the first annual robotics competition designed to encourage youths to pursue careers in math and science.
