Another suspected acid attack has been launched in London, less than 24 hours after a spate of five similar incidents. The Metropolitan Police said they were called at around 5pm on Friday to reports of an attempted robbery of a moped in Dagenham. The rider, in his 20s, was approached by two men on another moped who squirted what was described as a “noxious substance” at him. They attempted to steal his moped but were unsuccessful, and the man was taken to hospital.
