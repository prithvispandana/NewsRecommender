A police helicopter crew used the aircraft to film a pair of swingers having sex in their garden, a jury has heard. Prosecutors said two police officers and two pilots who worked for South Yorkshire Police purposefully circled the property as a couple "brazenly put on a show" involving numerous sex acts. The men, who are facing misconduct in public office charges at Sheffield Crown Court, are also accused of filming naked sunbathers and naturists on a campsite.
