WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republican leaders are trotting out their new, but reeling, health care bill and angling toward a showdown vote next week amid signs that they have lots of work ahead to win over GOP lawmakers or face a resounding failure. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., planned to present the revamped measure rolling back much of President Barack Obama's health care law to GOP senators Thursday. He's aiming at a do-or-die vote next week on whether to begin debating the bill — a roll call for which he's got no margin for error.
