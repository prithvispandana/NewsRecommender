HONOLULU (AP) â€” A federal judge in Hawaii on Thursday expanded the list of family relationships needed by people seeking new visas from six mostly Muslim countries to avoid President Donald Trump's travel ban. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson ordered the government not to enforce the ban on grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins of people in the United States. "Common sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents," U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson said in his ruling. "Indeed grandparents are the epitome of close family members."
