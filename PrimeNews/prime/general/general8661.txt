Juan Manuel Montes, 23, speaks in a relative's home in western Mexico after he was deported by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Feb. 17, 2017. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security reverses itself on the status of Montes, who may be the first person who qualifies for a program to shield young immigrants to be deported by President Donald Trump. Authorities now acknowledge that Montes, qualified for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program but still defend the decision to return him to Mexico.
