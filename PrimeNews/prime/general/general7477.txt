Theresa May "shed a tear" when she saw the exit poll on general election night, the Prime Minister has said. In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live the PM said she was "shocked at the result that had come through" and that it "took a few minutes" to sink in. Asked whether she had cried, she said: "Yes, a little tear, at that moment". "It was when I heard the exit poll. To be honest with you, I didn't actually watch the exit poll myself â€“ I have a little bit of superstition about things like that," she said.
