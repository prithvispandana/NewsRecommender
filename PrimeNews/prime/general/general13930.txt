SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” Netflix is pulling in new viewers and award nominations in droves, but the online video service still faces a long-term problem: Its acclaimed programming line-up is costing far more money than what subscribers pay for it. That hasn't been a big issue so far, thanks to investors' willingness to accept scant profits in exchange for robust subscriber growth. Netflix delivered on that front again Monday, announcing that it added 5.2 million subscribers in the second quarter covering April to June. That's the largest increase ever during the period, which has always been the company's slowest time of year.
