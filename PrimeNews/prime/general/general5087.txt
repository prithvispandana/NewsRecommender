Protesters are arrested before members of the Ku Klux Klan arrive for a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia on July 8, 2017. The KKK is protesting the planned removal of a statue of General Robert E. Lee, who oversaw Confederate forces in the US Civil War. The afternoon rally in this quiet university town has been authorized by officials in Virginia and stirred heated debate in America, where critics say the far right has been energized by Donald Trump's election to the presidency.
