John McDonnell has hit back at Tony Blair’s criticism of Labour’s failure to fight a hard Brexit, describing him as out of touch with the public.

In an article insisting EU withdrawal can be stopped, Mr Blair said Jeremy Corbyn’s “ambiguity” about leaving the single market was a policy that could not be sustained.
