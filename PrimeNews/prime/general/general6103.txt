An IRA member who was part of the group behind the Birmingham pub bombings has apologised.   Michael Christopher Hayes - a self confessed bomb maker - told the BBC that he was sorry that innocent people had been killed in the 1974 blasts.  An eight minute delay before police were warned of their location had led to the death of 21 people, when they exploded in a pair of city centre pubs.  It was one of the worst single losses of life in the Troubles.
