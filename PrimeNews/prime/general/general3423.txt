EASTBOURNE, England (AP) â€” When Novak Djokovic walked into Wimbledon a year ago, he possessed all four Grand Slam trophies. On Tuesday, he'll return empty-handed. A third-round defeat to Sam Querrey last year at the All England Club was the stunning start of a prolonged slump, a slump which Djokovic hopes he is finally on the way to ending after winning his second title of the year in Eastbourne on Saturday. Djokovic won the Eastbourne International beating Gael Monfils 6-3, 6-4 in the final, his first title since Janaury and his third in a year.
