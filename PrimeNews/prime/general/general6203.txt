MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) â€” Nicholas Montes put on goggles and a catcher's mitt and crouched. The 13-year-old will never catch a 104 mph pitch from Aroldis Chapman. But at the All-Star FanFest, he felt what it's like to be Buster Posey snagging virtual strikes. "It was like I was actually in the game. When I was catching, I felt the ball move and everything," the Miami teen said enthusiastically Sunday. "And then when I saw it go in my glove, I tried touching the ball, but I felt the remote control thing. So it was pretty cool."
