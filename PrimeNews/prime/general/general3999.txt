PONCA CITY, Okla. (AP) â€” An Oklahoma woman is accused of trying to hire someone via Craigslist to travel to Israel and kill her ex-husband using ricin. Federal prosecutors charged 37-year-old Danielle Dana Layman on Saturday with using interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire. Prosecutors said in a news release Monday that Layman posted on the classifieds website advertising a seemingly innocent "10 day gig overseas."
