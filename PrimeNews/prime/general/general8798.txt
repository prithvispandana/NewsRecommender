WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Republican leaders unveiled a new health care bill in their increasingly desperate effort to deliver on seven years of promises to repeal and replace "Obamacare." They immediately lost two key votes, leaving none to spare as the party's own divisions put its top campaign pledge in serious jeopardy. President Donald Trump declared this week that failure would make him "very angry" and that he would blame Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. But talking with reporters aboard Air Force One en route to France, Trump also acknowledged the challenges lawmakers face.
