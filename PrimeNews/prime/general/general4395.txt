Johanna Konta won an exhausting epic first up on Centre Court today to reach the third round of Wimbledon for the first time in her career. Konta and Croatian youngster Donna Vekic played for more than three hours in the draining sun. Konta took the first set, Vekic the second before the home favourite eventually edged over the line 10-8 in the third.
