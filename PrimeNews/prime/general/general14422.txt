A huge, dangerous swhirl of disorganised hot air called Don is looking to threaten the Americas. The storm – which by coincidence has the same name as the US president – is "small," "not particularly well organised" and likely to fade away quickly, according to the National Hurricane Center, which gave it its name. But the experts who name storms have rejected the idea that it was named after Mr Trump as nothing more than a coincidence.
