Russia is cancelling its payments to the Council of Europe after claiming its members are being “persecuted”. A Foreign Ministry statement said Moscow’s contribution for 2017 was being withheld in response to a “rampant campaign…launched to persecute [Russian] parliamentarians”. No future payments will be made until the rights of the Russian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (Pace) “are fully restored”, it added.
