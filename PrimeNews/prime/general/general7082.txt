Anushka Sharma's alleged romance with cricketer boyfriend, Virat Kohli has been grabbing the spotlight for quite some time now. The two have been busy with their professional commitments, but have made sure to spend some quality time together.  A picture has surfaced online that shows the alleged couple out and about the streets of New York City. Virat was seen sporting grey trousers with a dark blue t-shirt, while Anushka was seen in black and white off-shoulder top which she paired with black shorts on their casual date. Looks like they managed to squeeze in some vacation time in between their hectic schedules.  On the work front, Anushka will be seen next in Shah Rukh Khan's 'Jab Harry Met Sejal'. She is also working on her home production 'Pari'.
