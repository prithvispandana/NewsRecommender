LONDON (AP) â€” The parents of terminally ill baby Charlie Gard say he will be taken off of life support at a London children's hospital. Chris Gard and Connie Yates said that Great Ormond Street Hospital will switch off life support Friday. The 10-month-old's parents' lost a bid to take him to the U.S. for trial therapy Tuesday when the European Court of Human Rights sided with earlier rulings that continued treatment would cause "significant harm."
