A man who abused two Muslim women before striking one of them in the face with a packet of bacon has been jailed. Alex Chivers made abusive comments to Muslim teen, who was walking down a road in Enfield, north London, with her mother on 8 June. After calling her "Isil scum" and shouting "you deserve this", he then struck her in the face with an open packet of bacon.    "The victim was not injured, but was very distressed," Scotland Yard said in a statement.
