Jeremy Corbyn has made a raft of appointments to Labour's front bench as he seeks to unite the party after cementing his position as leader. The Labour leader has given jobs to 20 MPs, including a number that have been openly critical of his leadership. Among those to be brought back into the fold are former Shadow Young People Secretary Gloria de Piero, who was the second MP to resign from the shadow cabinet last June citing concerns about Mr Corbyn's leadership.
