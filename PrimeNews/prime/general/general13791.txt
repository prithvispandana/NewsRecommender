NEW YORK (AP) â€” Cameras remained off Monday at the White House press briefing on orders of the Trump administration, sidelining one of daytime television's most popular features on the same day that ABC announced new digital programming tied to it. The last on-camera White House briefing was on June 29. Following rules set by the White House, news networks only began airing press secretary Sean Spicer's question-and-answer session after it was done. With still pictures of Spicer onscreen as he talked off-camera, it didn't make for gripping television. Fox News Channel and MSNBC both broke away to other stories before the session was finished.
