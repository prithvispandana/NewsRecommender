WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told Hispanic lawmakers on Wednesday that a program that protects young immigrants from deportation is likely illegal, though he is personally supportive, according to House members. Kelly attended a closed-door meeting with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who pressed him on former President Barack Obama's Deferred Actions for Childhood Arrival Program. DACA gives hundreds of thousands of young people brought into the country as children protection from deportation and a work permit.
