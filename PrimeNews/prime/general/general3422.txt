LONDON (AP) â€” Venus Williams won her first tennis match since being sued by the estate of a Florida man who died after a car crash police say she caused. The 10th-seeded Williams beat Elise Mertens 7-6 (7), 6-4 Monday in the first round at Wimbledon, a tournament the American has won five times. Last week, Williams was sued by the estate of a Florida man who died 13 days after a car crash. The lawsuit came one day after Palm Beach Gardens police released a report saying Williams caused the June 9 crash. "There are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and ... yeah. I'm completely speechless," Williams said before tearing up.
