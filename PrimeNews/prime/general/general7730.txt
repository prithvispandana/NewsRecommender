VATICAN CITY (AP) â€” Vatican prosecutors have indicted the former president and ex-treasurer of the Vatican-run children's hospital for allegedly diverting money from the hospital's foundation to pay for renovations on a top cardinal's apartment. The indictment ordered Giuseppe Profiti and Massimo Spina to stand trial, starting next Tuesday. The indictment accuses the two of using 422,000 euros ($481,000) from the Bambino Gesu pediatric hospital's fundraising foundation to pay for renovations of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone's apartment when he retired as the Vatican's secretary of state.
