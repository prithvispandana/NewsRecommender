JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Three Palestinian assailants opened fire on Israeli police from inside a major Jerusalem holy site Friday, killing two officers before being shot dead, police said. The rare attack from within the contested shrine, revered by both Muslims and Jews, raised new concerns about an escalation of violence. The sacred compound sits at the fault line of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and has triggered major confrontations in the past. Israel closed the site, known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount, for further weapons sweeps Friday.
