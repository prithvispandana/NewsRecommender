A teenager recovering from cancer has spoken of her devastation after her school banned her from its prom because she hadn't attended enough classes. Sixteen-year-old Alex Dallas, who attended Orminston Bolingbroke Academy in Runcorn, Cheshire, had been suffering from cancer from the age of four. In preparation for the prom, she decided to undergo a life-threatening operation to remove a tumour in her head in December last year, rather than in the summer.
