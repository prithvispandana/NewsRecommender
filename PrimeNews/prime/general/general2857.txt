Supporters of around 70 English football clubs have vowed to boycott The Sun over its coverage of the Hillsborough disaster. A motion passed unanimously by fans at the Football Supporters Federation (FSF) annual summit called on supporters to urge their clubs and retailers in their local area to stop selling the paper.Â  It was backed by fans of all 20 Premier League clubs and dozens of others from the lower leagues. The FSF has more than half a million members, who will now be asked to help spread the boycott.
