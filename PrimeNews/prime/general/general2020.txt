China criticised Boris Johnson's "incorrect" stance after he called for Hong Kong to make more progress towards democracy ahead of the 20th anniversary of the former British colony's return to Chinese authority.Â  The Foreign Ssecretary sparked anger in Beijing after saying it was crucial for Hong Kong to retain a "high degree of autonomy and rule of law" in a statement to mark the handover of power from the UK to China on 1 July 1997.
