Tens of thousands of Syrian refugees have returned to the country so far this year amid fresh hope for lasting ceasefires in some cities. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said it was seeing a “notable trend of spontaneous returns” from outside and inside the country. Around 31,000 refugees returned from neighbouring countries in the first six months of 2017, while more than 440,000 internally displaced people went back to their homes – a combined total of more than half a million people.
