DOYLESTOWN, Pa. (AP) â€” A drug dealer has confessed to killing four young Pennsylvania men after he felt cheated or threatened during three drug transactions and then burned their bodies at his family's farm in suburban Philadelphia, a person with firsthand knowledge of his confession said. The person spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity on Thursday because he was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the case against 20-year-old Cosmo DiNardo. "Every death was related to a purported drug transaction, and at the end of each one there's a killing," the person said.
