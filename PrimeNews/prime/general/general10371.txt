A ‘best dressed’ poll of female Wimbledon players by the Women’s Tennis Association has been criticised by professional players as sexist.  ‘It’s time for you to vote for your favorite Wimbledon whites!’ instructs the poll on the website of the WTA, an international body which governs women’s tennis. The page documents the attire of nine Wimbledon female tennis players, before asking readers to vote.
