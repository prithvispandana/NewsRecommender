WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Russian-American lobbyist who attended a meeting at Trump Tower last year is a former military officer long shadowed by allegations of connections to Russian intelligence. Rinat Akhmetshin dismisses these allegations as a "smear campaign." He says that before the fall of the Soviet Union he served in a military unit that was part of counterintelligence but that he was never formally trained as a spy.
