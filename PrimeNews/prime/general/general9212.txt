(AP) â€” Elected officials' practice of opening meetings in North Carolina with Christian prayer and inviting audience members to join is unconstitutional, a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a closely watched case likely headed for the U.S. Supreme Court. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that found Rowan County commissioners' prayer practice to be "unconstitutionally coercive."
