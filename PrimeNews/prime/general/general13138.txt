Jeremy Corbyn has urged Theresa May to “broaden” the Grenfell tower fire inquiry team in a move he says would give families “full confidence” in the process. The Labour leader wrote to the Prime Minister on Monday urging the Prime Minister to include representation from “those from minority backgrounds” to support the judge who had been appointed to lead it. He said that a move to “introduce a range of perspectives and experiences into the inquiry” would “help to both build trust and deliver justice”.
