SOUTHPORT, England (AP) â€” Beef is back on the menu at the British Open, and Andrew Johnston can only hope there's as much sizzle to be found at Royal Birkdale as there was last year when he made an entertaining run on the weekend at Royal Troon. There are brains here, too, thanks to a last minute win Sunday by Bryson DeChambeau, who defies golf convention with his swing thoughts and has physics formulas stamped on the back of his wedges. Golf in what seems now to be a permanent post-Tiger era remains alive and somewhat well. That's especially true on this side of the pond, where huge crowds will turn out this week for the 146th version of what they prefer here to call simply The Open.
