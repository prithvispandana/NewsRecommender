Police have arrested a second teenager in connection with a string of acid attacks that took place in north and east London. A 15-year-old boy was detained at an address in Stoke Newington on suspicion of robbery and causing grievous bodily harm after a 90-minute rampage saw five men doused with a noxious substance on Thursday night. Another boy, 16 years old, had already been held on suspicion of the same offences in the early hours of this morning after he was identified near the scene of the offences by council CCTV operators.
