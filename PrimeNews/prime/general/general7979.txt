WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Donald Trump continued Thursday to defend his son's meeting with a Russian lawyer, characterizing it as standard campaign practice and maintaining that "nothing happened" as a result of the June sit-down. The remarks in Paris, made in a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron, came even though Trump's own FBI pick said one day earlier that authorities should be advised of campaign meeting requests with foreign individuals and even after Donald Trump Jr. said he would rethink his own conduct in taking it in the first place.
