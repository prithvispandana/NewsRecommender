The aggregate real disposable income of UK households has fallen for three quarters in a row for the first time since the 1970s, according to the Office for National Statistics. The ONS said that the inflation-adjusted compensation of the household sectorÂ fell 1.4 per cent in the first three months of 2017, reflecting spiking inflation and weak pay growth.
