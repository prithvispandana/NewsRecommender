The US has been testing hypersonic aircraft missiles that could fly at a mile per second. It has collaborated with Australia to research and pilot weapons able to fly at least five times faster than the speed of sound - anywhere from 3,836mph up to 7,700 mph.  The latest phase of the Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation  (HiFIRE) programme included at least one successful hypersonic flight at Woomera testing range in South Australia.
