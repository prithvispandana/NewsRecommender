CAIRO (AP) â€” Foreign ministers from four Arab nations seeking to isolate Qatar over its alleged support for extremist groups met on Wednesday in the Egyptian capital, just hours after they said they had received Doha's response to their demands for ending the diplomatic crisis roiling the Persian Gulf. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain said in a joint statement earlier that they would respond "in a timely manner" to Qatar's reply. They did not elaborate on what steps they could take, though a major credit rating agency warned it had changed Qatar's economic outlook to negative over the turmoil.
