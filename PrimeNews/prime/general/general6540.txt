A Democratic representative has introduced the first formal article of impeachment against President Donald Trump.Â  Representative Brad Sherman alleges Mr Trump committed obstruction of justice by firing former FBI Director James Comey amid agency investigations into Russian meddling in the US election. "Such conduct," Mr Sherman writes in the article, "warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office."
