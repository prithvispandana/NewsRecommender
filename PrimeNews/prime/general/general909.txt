WASHINGTON (AP) â€” With President Donald Trump's travel ban taking effect, the White House declared victory on the first major policy push of his presidency. But it could not have been the win Trump imagined. What was once described as a blanket ban on Muslims, and then became a temporary ban on visitors from seven majority-Muslim countries, is now a list of confusing new visa restrictions. Trump's eye-popping campaign promise to deliver security by limiting entry into the U.S. has become the incredible shrinking travel ban, a plan rewritten, tweaked, watered down and litigated nearly beyond recognition.
