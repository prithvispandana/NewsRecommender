Senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper has said she is “sick to death of the vitriol” and misogyny aimed at the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. The journalist, who holds one of the most recognisable and important jobs in broadcast media, has frequently been subject to accusations of bias against Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn by his supporters.  Many on the right have also accused Ms Kuenssberg and other BBC journalists of biased reporting. Ms Cooper, who chairs the Commons' Home Affairs Select Committee, called for the BBC to be defended.
