Diane Abbott has spoken of how she has been repeatedly labelled a "n*****" in a stream of racist and sexist abuse. The Shadow Home Secretary revealed the extent of the "mindless abuse" she has received as an MP through emails and social media, and said the online attacks had got worse in recent years. Speaking during a Westminster Hall debate on the intimidation and abuse of candidates in elections, Ms Abbott said she had received rape and death threats, and had been described as an "ugly fat black bitch" and a "n*****".
