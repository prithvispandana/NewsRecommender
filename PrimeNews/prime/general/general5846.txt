North Korea has accused the US and South Korea of pushing the region to the "tipping point" of nuclear war.  Pyongyang was furious after the US deployed two bombers near its border in a show of force that it slammed as a "military provocation". It warned a nuclear war "would inevitably lead to another world war".  The US Air Force bombers dropped inert weapons over a training range in South Korea and fighter jets from both countries took part in rare live-fire drills.
