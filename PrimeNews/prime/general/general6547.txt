MPs on the predominantly Catholic island of Malta have voted to legalise same-sex marriage. In a vote passed by 66-1, Malta’s parliament approved legislation replacing the traditional "you are now husband and wife" declaration in civil ceremonies with "you are now spouses”. The sole MP who voted against the change said he did so because of his faith.  "A Christian politician cannot leave his conscience outside the door" when he enters parliament, Edwin Vassallo said.
