Kensington and Chelsea Council should be stripped of its powers following the “utter chaos” that has resulted from its handling of the Grenfell fire disaster, according survivors’ groups and the Labour Party. They said the Government should impose new commissioners to run the local authority, which was plunged into further turmoil today after its leader, Nick Paget-Brown, quit after coming under intense pressure for his handling of the disaster, which claimed at least 80 lives.
