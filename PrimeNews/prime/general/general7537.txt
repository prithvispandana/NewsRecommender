Superstar Amitabh Bachchan threatened to send a legal notice to AAP leader and poet Kumar Vishwas, accusing him of "copyright infringement" for unauthorised use of a poem penned by his late father, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, in a video paying tribute to renowned Hindi poets. In the video, which was uploaded on Youtube and shared on social networking sites, Kumar can be heard reciting a poem written by Harivansh Rai Bachchan. When Bachchan was tagged by a fan in a tweet urging him to watch the video, he replied, "This is a copyright infringement. Legal will take care of this".

  According to reports, Vishwas then received a legal notice from Bachchan, asking him to take down the video from Youtube within 24 hours and threatening legal action for failure to comply. He also demanded an account of the revenue generated through "exploitation of the poem". On Wednesday, Vishwas tweeted that he had received appreciation from the families of all the poets he had paid tribute to in his videos, and it was only Bachchan who had reacted by serving him a legal notice. Vishwas then said the video has been deleted from Youtube and he would be sending his earnings from the video - a meagre Rs 32, as he tweeted, "Rcvd appreciation frm all poet's family but Notice frm you Sir. Deleting the Tribute video to Babuji. Sending earned Rs 32 as demanded. Pranam"
