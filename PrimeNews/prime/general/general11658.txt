Senior German politicians reportedly launched a scathing attack on their British counterparts, calling them a “disgrace” and labelling their response to Brexit “farcical” during a meeting in the Bundestag.  Irish and German figures gathered at an Oireachtas delegation held by the German Parliament’s finance committee to discuss Brexit.  Fine Gael senator Ray Butler, who attended the meeting, said the German politicians were speaking after a recent visit to Westminster.
