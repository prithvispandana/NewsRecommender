The Chinese activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo has died at the age of 61, the government has said. The country's most famous political prisoner was being treated for terminal liver cancer in a heavily-guarded hospital in north-eastern China. Mr Liu had been transferred from prison last month where he was serving an 11-year term for "subversion". Mr Liu might be a name rarely uttered in the west but many argueÂ the unsung hero must be remembered alongside the other big name dissidents of the twentieth century.
