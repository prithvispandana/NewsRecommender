Labour’s 2017 general election campaign was less effective at turning votes into parliamentary seats than any since the 1950s, new analysis has revealed. Jeremy Corbyn’s party won 40 per cent of votes in the 8 June poll but just 262 House of Commons seats – only four more than in 2010, when it received just 29 per cent of the vote.
