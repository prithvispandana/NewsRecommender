SNOWBIRD, Utah (AP) â€” A Utah man celebrated his 100th birthday by doing what he loves most: Skiing. Snowbird Ski Resort took advantage of lingering snow to groom a short run for George Jedenoff to cruise down Wednesday before he was given a cake and plaque with one of his favorite sayings: "Age is just a number." In a birthday speech, Jedenoff echoed those words. "Don't let the age bother you," he said. "Don't let the negative things in your life, of which we all have a lot, outweigh all the positive blessings that you have."
