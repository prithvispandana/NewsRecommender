PARIS (AP) â€” The Latest on President Donald Trump's visit to Paris (all times local): 10:25 a.m. President Donald Trump is urging fellow Republicans to approve a health care plan in the Senate, declaring on Twitter it "must happen!" Trump is tweeting shortly before his appearance at the annual Bastille Day parade in Paris. He says Republican senators are working hard to "get their failed ObamaCare replacement approved" and says he'll "be at my desk, pen in hand!" The president says it's important for Republicans under Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to get a health care plan approved. And he's crediting Vice President Mike Pence for working to get GOP senators "to do what is right for the people." Trump's pressure comes as a new health care plan released by Republican leaders faces opposition in the Senate.
