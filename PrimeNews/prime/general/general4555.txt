Andy Murray made light work of crowd-pleaser Dustin Brown to cap a brilliant day for British players at Wimbledon. The world number one's 6-3 6-2 6-2 victory over Brown meant success for all four home singles players on Wednesday, with Murray's win following those of Johanna Konta, Heather Watson and Aljaz Bedene. It is the first time in 20 years that Britain has four players into the third round of the singles, and Kyle Edmund could make that five when he takes on Gael Monfils on Thursday.
