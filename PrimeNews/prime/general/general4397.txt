A 52-year-old man from Sussex has been convicted of the manslaughter of one girlfriend and the murder of another. Robert TriggÂ murdered Susan Nicholson in 2011 as they slept on a sofa together, five years after he killed another partner, Caroline Devlin, 35, in her bed. Neither death was thought to be suspicious at the time.
