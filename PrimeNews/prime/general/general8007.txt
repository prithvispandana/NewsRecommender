Jeremy Corbyn has met with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator in Brussels, with the two leaders seeming to form a friendly relationship – in contrast with the apparent hostility between European officials and Tory government ministers that has developed in recent months.  The Labour leader presented Michel Barnier, the former French foreign minister, with an Arsenal shirt with his name on the back. Mr Corbyn is a lifelong Arsenal fan and the club’s longstanding manager, Arsene Wenger, is French.
