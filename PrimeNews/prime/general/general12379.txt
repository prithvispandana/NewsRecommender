Theresa May should make Jeremy Corbyn a member of her Brexit negotiating team, a top EU official has suggested.  Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, said the Prime Minister losing her majority in the general election was a “rejection” of her hard Brexit plan and other voices should be listened to as negotiations with the European Union get into full swing.
