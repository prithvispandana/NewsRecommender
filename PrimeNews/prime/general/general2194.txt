The woman was driving around 2 a.m. when she lost control of her white Pontiac eastbound on the North Loop near Lockwood Drive, and hit one of the barriers that divide the east- and westbound lanes of the freeway, according to Sgt. Thomas Fendia with the Houston Police Department.Â   A police officer who was making an arrest near the scene also witnessed the crash, Fendia said.
