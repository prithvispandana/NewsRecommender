An elephant was rescued after it was found swimming more than nine miles off the coast of Sri Lanka. The creature had been dragged into the open sea by a current, the country's Navy said in a statement.   One of its fast attack craft found it during a routine patrol, the force said, adding that a second craft and a team of divers had been dispatched to the sea off Kokkuthuduwai, Kokilai.
