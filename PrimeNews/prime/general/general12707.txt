George A Romero, the legendary film director and creator of the modern movie zombie empire, has died at 77, according to his family. The Bronx-born, Night of the Living Dead director died in his sleep after a “brief but aggressive battle with lung cancer”, said his manager Chris Roe in a statement. “[Romero] leaves behind a loving family, many friends, and a filmmaking legacy that has endured, and will continue to endure, the test of time.”
