EDMONTON — It's Weed Wednesday at the premiers meeting in Edmonton.

	The leaders of Canada's provinces and territories are set to compare notes on how to handle the rules when the federal government legalizes recreational use of cannabis next July.

	While Ottawa will pass the enabling legislation, it will be up to the provinces to decide how cannabis will be distributed and sold, what public places it will be allowed and whether the minimum age to buy it will be higher than 18.
