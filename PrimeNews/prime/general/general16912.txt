THE ARCTIC CIRCLE (AP) â€” European explorers had long speculated about the existence of an Arctic route that connected the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and would avoid the long journey around South America's Cape Horn. For centuries, able seafarers failed to find the Northwest Passage, among them John Cabot, Henry Hudson, Francis Drake and James Cook. Harsh weather, thick ice and treacherous shallows forced many expeditions to turn back. Those that didn't ended in disaster, such as the expedition led by British naval officer John Franklin in 1845.
