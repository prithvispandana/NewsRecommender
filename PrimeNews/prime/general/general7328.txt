DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) â€” The U.S.'s top diplomat was expected to travel back to Qatar on Thursday for more talks with the country's 37-year-old emir, a day after wrapping up discussions with the king of Saudi Arabia and other officials from Arab countries lined up against Qatar. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's travels have so far not led to any signs of a breakthrough in an increasingly entrenched dispute that has divided some of America's most important Mideast allies.
