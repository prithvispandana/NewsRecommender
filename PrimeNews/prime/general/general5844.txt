Team Sky’s rollercoaster Tour de France continued apace on Sunday as Chris Froome strengthened his overall lead but his team-mate Geraint Thomas crashed out with a suspected broken collarbone. On a ferociously difficult, crash-littered, mountain stage across the Jura, one of the most serious accidents came when Froome’s arch-rival Richie Porte fell heavily on the lethal descent of the Col du Chat, skidding into a rockface and injuring his head. Porte was transported to hospital in an ambulance, but initial reports say he is out of danger.
