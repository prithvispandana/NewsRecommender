A man who was stabbed to death near Greenwich Park thought his killers were joking when they pulled out a gun and ordered him to hand over his smartphone moments before the fatal attack, according to an eyewitness.Â  The 31-year-old victim and his friends were approached by two men on a moped in King William Walk, Greenwich, south-east London, in the early hours of Saturday morning, it is said.
