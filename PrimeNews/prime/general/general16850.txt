Grenfell Tower residents heckled and booed the new leader of Kensington and Chelsea council during a stormy public meeting.  Shouts of "shame on you" rang out from the chamber as Elizabeth Campbell was formally elected after being nominated by the local Conservative group. Others cried out “murderers”.  She replaced former council leader Nicholas Paget-Brown, who resigned in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed at least 80 people.
