Akshay Kumar and Bhumi Pednekar starrer 'Toilet: Ek Prem Katha' has come under the scanner due to copyright allegations made by director Praveen Vyas last week. The film ran into legal trouble when Vyas claimed that the upcoming film had "striking similarities" with his documentary feature 'Manini' which won the third prize at last year's International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa.  The producers of the Akshay-Bhumi starrer have now come forward to rubbish the claims. Prernaa Arora co-producer of the film, termed the allegations as "baseless and untrue", stating that the script of the film belonged to the writers since 2013.  Producer and co-founder of Friday Film Works, Shital Bhatia has also reportedly denied all misleading claims and was quoted saying that the film was based largely on open defecation in the country. They also said that it was "ridiculous, frustrating and insulting" to say that they have "copied someone's work".  According to latest reports, the makers are even threatening to file a defamation case against Vyas.  Helmed by Shree Narayan Singh, 'Toilet: Ek Prem Katha' is slated to release on 11 August 2017.
