WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he's ready to unwrap his latest bill repealing much of President Barack Obama's health care law, with wary conservatives warning Wednesday that they're watching to make sure it doesn't stray from their goals. McConnell, R-Ky., planned to release the revised measure on Thursday, despite no visible signs that leaders have rounded up enough GOP support to win its passage. He says the Senate will begin voting on the legislation next week in a showdown over one of the party's top priorities — repealing much of Obama's health care law.
