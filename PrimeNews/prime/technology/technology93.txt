The Unreal Engine project continues to develop - new code is added, and previously written code is changed. The inevitable consequence of the development in a project? The emergence of new bugs in the code that a programmer wants to identify as early as possible. One of the ways to reduce the number of errors is the use of the static analyzer, 'PVS-Studio'. Moreover, the analyzer is not only evolving, but also constantly learning to look for new error patterns, some of which we will discuss in this article. If you care about code quality, this article is for you.
