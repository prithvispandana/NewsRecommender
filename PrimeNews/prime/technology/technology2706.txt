The Titanic challenge on Kaggle is a competition in which the task is to predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on a set of variables describing him such as his age, his sex, or his passenger class on the boat. I have been playing with the Titanic dataset for a while, and I have recently achieved an accuracy score of 0.8134 on the public leaderboard. As I'm writing this post, I am ranked among the top 9% of all Kagglers: More than 4540 teams are currently competing. This post is the opportunity to share my solution with you.
