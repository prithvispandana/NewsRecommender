In lesson 8 of Practical Deep Learning For Coders, Part 2 by Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas, Jeremy encouraged everyone to do a project. I didnâ€™t attend the course in-person and watched the videos when they were released(still in preview) on the forums. 
So, I asked Jeremy whether Image Captioning was implemented in this part of the course and he suggested that it would be a good class project. Hence, I decided that Image Captioning would be my project.
