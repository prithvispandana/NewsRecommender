Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, one of the most popular leaders the country has ever had, was sentenced to nine and half years for graft and money-laundering on July 12. If his conviction is upheld by an appeals court, he will be barred from running for the nationâ€™s top job. Latest opinion polls show him as the front-runner in the 2018 presidential election.
