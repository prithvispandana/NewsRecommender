Paul Pogba has shaken off criticism of Manchester United's 2016-17 campaign by stating winning trophies is "all that matters". Jose Mourinho's first year at Old Trafford resulted in three additions to the Old Trafford trophy cabinet in the form of the Europa League, League Cup and Community Shield. However, having spent a world-record fee on Pogba, which could be worth up to 110million euros (Â£92.35million), and acquired Zlatan Ibrahimovic in his first transfer window, Mourinho's side were expected to fare better than their eventual sixth-placed Premier League finish.
