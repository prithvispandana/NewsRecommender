Brendan Rodgers insists discipline is not an issue at Celtic despite two UEFA charges arising from their Champions League qualifying clash with Linfield. The European governing body opened a case against striker Leigh Griffiths for tying a Hoops scarf to a goal post after the 2-0 win at Windsor Park on Friday. UEFA has also instigated disciplinary action against Celtic after picking up five yellow cards, one of which was controversially given to Griffiths for presumably taking too long at a corner when he was being pelted with missiles - including a glass bottle.
