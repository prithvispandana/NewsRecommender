Nice starlet Vincent Marcel has agreed personal terms with Tottenham, claim reports in France. The midfielder caught the eye in France last season and Nantes have been tracking him during the current window. But, according to Foot Mercato, the 20-year-old has now provisionally agreed to join Tottenham. Spurs are said to have offered Marcel a five-year deal and he has jumped at the opportunity to work with Mauricio Pochettino. Tottenham now need to agree a fee with Nice for the Frenchman, who still has four years on his present deal.
