Romelu Lukaku has described Man United as ‘the biggest club in the world’ and admits he didn’t have to think twice about joining when the opportunity arose. United announced on Saturday they had reached an agreement with Everton to sign the 24-year-old in a deal understood to be worth an initial £75m. Lukaku, who has been on holiday in America, is now set to put the finishing touches on the switch and should then be able to link up with Jose Mourinho's side on their pre-season tour of the States.
