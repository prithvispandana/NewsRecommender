Middlesbrough have announced a club-record deal to sign Britt Assombalonga from Nottingham Forest. The 24-year-old striker has signed for Garry Monk's Championship side despite an injury-hit three years at the City Ground. Assombalonga is a proven goalscorer in the Championship, having netted 30 times in 47 league starts since signing for Â£5.5million in 2014. However, persistent injuries have held back his progress, with a serious knee injury ruling him out for much of the 2015-16 season, but he signed a new five-year deal last summer after proving his fitness.
