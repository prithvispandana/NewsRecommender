Andy Murray found early answers to Dustin Brown's box of tricks as he took the first set of their second-round clash 6-3 at Wimbledon. After the tension of Johanna Konta's epic victory over Donna Vekic, this was entertainment of a different sort for the Centre Court crowd. Brown, dreadlocks flapping wildly as he charged to the net, gave Murray's dodgy right hip a thorough examination with a succession of drop shots, volleys and lobs.
