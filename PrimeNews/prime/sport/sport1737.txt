Former Chelsea and West Ham striker Carlton Cole believes the Blues should keep hold of Diego Costa despite Antonio Conte telling the striker he was no longer wanted at the club. The Spanish international appeared to be on his way out of the club after the bust-up with his manager but the Blues have found it difficult signing a suitable replacement. Their number one target, former forward Romelu Lukaku, is on the verge of joining Manchester United in what was a bitter blow to Conte and his plans for next season.
