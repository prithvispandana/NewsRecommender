Contract rebel Emre Can could well leave Liverpool this summer, with both Juventus and Lazio keeping close tabs on his situation. The Germany international is the subject of intense speculation after reports emerged suggesting that the 23-year-old wouldn't be signing a new contract worth Â£100,000 per-week. And, according to reports in Italy, Lazio have now joined Juventus in the chase for Can with the midfielder's contract situation showing no signs of progression.
