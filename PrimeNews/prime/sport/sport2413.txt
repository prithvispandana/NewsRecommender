Manchester United have been dealt a blow in their hunt to sign Internazionale winger Ivan Perisic this summer. The 28-year-old Croatia international is said to be one of Jose Mourinho's priority targets as the Portuguese looks to rebuild his squad ahead of the new Premier League campaign. The Red Devils want to have a deal for Perisic wrapped up before they head to China on their pre-season tour, though disagreements over the two clubs' valuation of the attacker mean no agreement has been found as of yet.
