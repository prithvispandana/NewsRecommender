Sam Allardyce has told talkSPORT he would only consider a return to football management for the right international role, insisting his time saving clubs from relegation is over. Allardyce left Crystal Palace at the end of the season after just five months in charge, having successfully saved the Eagles fromÂ Premier League relegation. The 62-year-old was one of the go-to men in England for in-trouble clubs throughout his career, having kept the likes of Bolton, Blackburn, West Ham and Sunderland in the top flight, as well as the Eagles last season.
