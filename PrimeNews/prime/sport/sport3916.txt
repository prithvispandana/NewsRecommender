It is being reported that Liverpool are on the verge of signing 23-year-old Scotland international Andrew Robertson from Hull. The left-back will cost Â£8m and become the latest in a long line of Scottish players to play for Liverpool. The deal is likely to annoy some fans, who may have preferred a glamourous, exotic name to join instead of Robertson.
