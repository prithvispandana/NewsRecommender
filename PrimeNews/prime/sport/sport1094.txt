Former goalkeeper Jens Lehmann is to join Arsenal as a first-team coach. It is understood the German will return to the Gunners for a third time, following two stints as a player, as manager Arsene Wenger tinkers with his backroom staff. Gerry Peyton is the Gunners' goalkeeping coach, with Lehmann to augment the coaching staff in a general role with the first team. The 47-year-old Lehmann joined Arsenal from Borussia Dortmund in July 2003 and made 200 first-team appearances for the Gunners.
