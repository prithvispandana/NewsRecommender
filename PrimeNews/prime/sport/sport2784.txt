England hit back to take four wickets in the evening session but could still claim only a share of the spoils on the first day of the second Test against South Africa at Trent Bridge. Stuart Broad, returning to his home ground for the first time in a Test since his eight for 15 when England clinched the Ashes here two years ago, shifted third-wicket pair Quinton de Kock (68) and Hashim Amla (78) in a spell of 5-2-8-2 after tea.
