Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg have joined Tottenham in the race for AC Milan playmaker Suso. The Spaniard has found his best form in Italy after being deemed surplus to requirements at Liverpool. Tottenham are now keen on bringing the midfielder back to England and he is willing to listen to offers. But, according to Corriere dello Sport, Spurs do not have it all their own way as Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg are after Suso too. The German pair have reportedly been scouting the 23-year-old for a number of months and they are now ready to swoop.
