Nice could be about to step up their pursuit of Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma after the departure of Paul Baysse. The centre-back left the Ligue 1 club on a free transfer and has agreed a four-year deal at Malaga. It means Nice are now desperate to bring in defensive reinforcements while the window is open. They have been linked with a move for Zouma in the past and they are now set to explore the possibility of a loan swoop.
