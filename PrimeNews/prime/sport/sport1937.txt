Stoke forward Marko Arnautovic has handed in a transfer request, it is understood.  The 28-year-old has asked to leave the bet365 Stadium with West Ham interested in signing him. Arnautovic, who only signed a new four-year deal at Stoke last summer, is currently with the squad in Switzerland for their pre-season training camp. Stoke have made no decision over the request and Arnautovic is due to play against Neuchatel Xamax on Monday as the Potters kick off their pre-season programme.
