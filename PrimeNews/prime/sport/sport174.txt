Manchester United have made one signing so far this summer, with Swedish star Victor Lindelof brought in from Benfica to add some technical quality to their defence. The ball-playing defender, though, is set to be joined at the club by another former Benfica man – Nemanja Matic. Currently with Premier League champions Chelsea, Red Devils boss Jose Mourinho so adores the Serbian maestro, he’s going to give £40million to the Blues in order to be reunited with him.
