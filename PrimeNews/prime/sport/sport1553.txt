Fernando Torres has signed a new contract until 2018 with Atletico Madrid, the LaLiga club have announced. The 33-year-old temporarily became a free-agent at the start of July, but has ended any speculation he could depart his boyhood club for a second time after agreeing fresh terms with Diego Simeone’s side. Torres’ renewal will come as a boost to the capital club due to their transfer ban which restricts them from registering new players until January 2018.
