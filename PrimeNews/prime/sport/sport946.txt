Junior Sa'u scored two tries as Salford jumped to second in Super League with a 36-14 victory over Huddersfield. Ian Watson's side had lost their last three league games but they recovered from going behind in the sixth minute to score three tries in seven minutes during a devastating first-half spell. Half-backs Robert Lui and Michael Dobson were in commanding form for Salford, with Dobson kicking two 40-20s in the second half which led to tries.
