Lugano striker Ezgjan Alioski is due to have a medical at Leeds this week, according to reports in Switzerland. The 25-year-old, who hit 16 goals in 34 league appearances in the Swiss top flight last term, has been heavily linked with a move to Elland Road in recent weeks. And now it has been reported that the Championship club have finally agreed terms with Lugano after heavy negotiations. The Macedonia international was left out of the club's pre-season friendly against AC Milan and his profile has even been taken off their website.
