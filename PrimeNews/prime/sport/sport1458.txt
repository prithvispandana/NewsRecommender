Former Metz striker Boris Mathis has signed a two-year contract with Everton to play in their Premier League 2-winning under-23s squad. The 19-year-old, a product of Lyon's academy who made his Ligue 1 debut in April, was out of contract this summer. "My dream is to play for the first team here. I want to play in the Premier League for Everton," he told evertonfc.com. "Ronald Koeman is a huge figure, not only as a coach now but his reputation as a player speaks for itself as well."
