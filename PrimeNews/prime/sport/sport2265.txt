Crystal Palace and West Brom are keen on signing former Arsenal and Manchester City defender Bacary Sagna. The right-back was not offered a new deal by City boss Pep Guardiola and is now on the hunt for a new club – but he is not short of options. And, despite interest from his native France, the 34-year-old could be set to extend his stay in England with both Palace and West Brom keen on landing him, according to L'Equipe. The 34-year-old has a wealth of experience in the Premier League, where he has played his football for the past decade.
