Sam Allardyce revealed his wifeÂ wanted him to give up management a long time ago as he explained his reasoning behind his Crystal Palace departure. After taking the job midway through the season, the former England boss managed to lead a successful resurgence as the club saved themselves from relegation. However, just days after safety was secured, Allardyce announced his intention to leave the club and head into possible retirement. And, speaking to Jim White on talkSPORT, the 62-year-old manager admitted his mind was made up before their final game of the season.
