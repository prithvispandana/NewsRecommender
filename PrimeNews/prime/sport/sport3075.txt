Chelsea have announced the signing of Tiemoue Bakayoko from Monaco, with the midfielder signing a five-year deal. The 22-year-old played a key role in Monaco's Ligue 1 triumph and excitingÂ run to the semi-finals of the Champions League last season. He's likely to take the place of Nemanja Matic in the Blues squad, as the Serb is expected to, along with Diego Costa, miss their pre-season tour of Asia to negotiate an exit.
