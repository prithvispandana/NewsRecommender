Roma will move for Wolfsburg's Yannick Gerhardt or Jonathan Castro of Celta Vigo â€“ if they cannot tie up a deal for Liverpool defender Alberto Moreno. The Italian club are in talks with the Anfield club over a move for the Spaniard as he looks set to find a new challenge this summer. The 24-year-old has struggled for action under Jurgen Klopp, with James Milner starting the majority of games at left-back instead of him. Roma are now ready to give Moreno the first-team football he craves, but as of yet they have not been able to agree a fee.
