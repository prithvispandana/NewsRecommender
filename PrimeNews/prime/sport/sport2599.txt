Our pals at Dream Team caught up with Brazil and Barcelona super star Neymar, for a chat about his future, the Premier League and cold nights at Stoke City... Can you imagine moving to the Premier League? No, no not yet. To be honest I’ve never thought about living in England. I do watch the Premier League a little bit, but then again I don’t like to watch too much football.
