Joe Root thanked his England team for pulling together exactly as he asked to ensure his tenure as captain got off to flying start with a wide-margin win over South Africa. Moeen Ali finished with a match haul of 10 for 112 as England triumphed by 211 runs after 19 wickets fell in less than 73 overs on a decisive fourth day of the first Test at Lord's. The all-rounder therefore edged the man-of-the-match award ahead of Root himself, who hit 190 in England's first innings.
