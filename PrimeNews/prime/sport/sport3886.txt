Paris Saint-Germain are heading the race to sign Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez, according to reports in France. It has been claimed the Chile international is ready to leave the Gunners this summer in search of Champions League football next season. Manchester City are also said to be interested in the 28-year-old, but Arsenal's reluctance to sell to a direct Premier League rival could scupper their chances. Bayern Munich have recently pulled out of negotiations due to financial concerns over the costs of a deal, leaving PSG firmly in the driving seat.
