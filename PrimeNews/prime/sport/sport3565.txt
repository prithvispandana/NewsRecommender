Bournemouth and Watford are chasing Lyon midfielder Jordan Ferri. The 25-year-old made just 11 starts in Ligue 1 last season and there has been talk he could leave in search of more game time. Several clubs in France are keen on the Frenchman, while he is said to have offers from Spain too. But, according to L'Equipe, now Bournemouth and Watford are both fighting to catch Ferri this summer. The Premier League pair have been alerted to the midfielder's situation and they want to snap him up.
