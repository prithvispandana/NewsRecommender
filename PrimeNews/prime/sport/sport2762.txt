Celtic took the first step towards the Champions League with a comfortable 2-0 win over part-time Linfield at Windsor Park. The Parkhead club had refused their ticket allocation for the first leg of the second qualifying round clash in Belfast due to safety fears. However, there were around 300 Hoops fans in the Kop stand, set aside for them in a half-full stadium, to see attacker Scott Sinclair head Brendan Rodgers' side ahead in the 17th minute before midfielder Tom Rogic made it 2-0 five minutes later.
