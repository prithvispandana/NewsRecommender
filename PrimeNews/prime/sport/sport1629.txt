Alastair Cook established a commanding position for England after they bowled South Africa out for 361 on day three of the first Investec Test at Lord's. Cook (59no) and Keaton Jennings both had a little good fortune in an opening stand of 80 on the way to 119 for one at stumps, giving England an overall lead of 216 despite the earlier resistance of Quinton de Kock (51) and Vernon Philander (52).
