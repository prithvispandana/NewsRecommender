Manchester City's signing of teenager Benjamin Garre will be heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Monday. City signed Garre at the age of 16 but the teenager's Argentinian club Velez Sarsfield claimed the move breached world governing body FIFA's rules over the signing of minors from outside the European Union. Velez appealed to the CAS after FIFA ruled in City's favour following a complaint about Garre's move to the Premier League club in July 2016.
