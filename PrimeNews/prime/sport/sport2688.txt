Manchester City have signed England international Kyle Walker from Tottenham Hotspur on a five-year contract, the Premier League club have confirmed. It is understood Pep Guardiola's side agreed a fee with Spurs for the 27-year-old which could rise to £50million if the add-on clauses are met. Walker, who has signed a five-year deal at the Etihad Stadium, therefore becomes one of the most expensive defenders of all time.
