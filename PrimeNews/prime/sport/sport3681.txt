Luke Shaw has seen another summer dominated by rehabilitation but the Manchester United left-back is relishing the challenge of getting back to full fitness and into Jose Mourinho's starting line-up. Rather than relaxing on a sun lounger, the 22-year-old has again spent much of his break working hard with the club's medical staff at the Aon Training Complex. Shaw returned early to pre-season last year in a bid to hit the ground running following a horrific double leg break and this summer has followed a similar pattern after sustaining ligament damage in his foot.
