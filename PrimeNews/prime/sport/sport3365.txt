Every now and again, Fantasy Premier League classifies a player incorrectly and supporters love to exploit it. Last season a number of managers were able to squeeze extra points out of stars who were given the wrong role. Joshua King was one of those men who, thanks to being listed as a midfielder instead of a forward, put bosses at an advantage. Sadly, the loophole has been close and those in the know at FPL headquarters have made him a forward for the 2017/18 season.
