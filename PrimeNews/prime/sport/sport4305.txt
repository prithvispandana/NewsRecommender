AC Milan have reignited their interest in Everton target Nikola Kalinic after reportedly missing out on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. With the Gabon international set to stay at Borussia Dortmund, Milan have once again set their sights on Kalinic, who is attracting the interest of several clubs around Europe. Everton were linked with the Fiorentina forward and they are on the hunt for a replacement for Romelu Lukaku, who joined Manchester United earlier in the window.
