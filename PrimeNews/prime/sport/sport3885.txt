Spanish giants Sevilla have entered the mix for Newcastle United target Ryad Boudebouz, according to reports in France. Montpellier have agreed to let Boudebouz move on this summer for the right price and the Algeria international has been linked with Newcastle, Lazio and Bayer Leverkusen. However, no club have yet reached an agreement with the French side for Boudebouz and, according to France Football, Sevilla have now joined the chase. The 27-year-old was in fine form for Montpellier last season, chipping in with 11 goals in 33 Ligue 1 games.
