Widnes Vikings 8-36Â Wakefield Trinity Wakefield centre Bill Tupou inspired his side to a crucial 36-8 victory over Widnes Vikings to maintain their push for a top-four finish in Super League. The 27-year-old Kiwi was in sparkling form for Trinity as he showed tremendous pace to score two tries and created two others for winger Mason Caton-Brown and was a constant thorn in the Vikings defence.
