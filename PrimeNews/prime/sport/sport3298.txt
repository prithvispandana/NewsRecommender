Clinton Njie has joined Marseille on a permanent deal from Tottenham. The Cameroon forward joined the club in 2015, but spent last season on loan on at the Ligue 1 side, having failed to secure a regular role at White Hart Lane. The 23-year-old did not start a single Premier League game for Spurs, making eight substitute appearances after arriving from Lyon in a deal reportedly worth more than £8million. After returning to France he scored four times in 22 outings for Marseille.
