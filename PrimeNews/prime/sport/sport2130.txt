Stoke have rejected a bid of £20million from West Ham for forward Marko Arnautovic. The 28-year-old asked to leave the bet365 Stadium earlier his week, handing in a transfer request, and it is understood the Hammers have made a move. However, with Arnautovic only 12 months into a four-year contract, the Potters have a strong bargaining position and have turned down the London club's advances. Arnautovic is currently with the squad in Switzerland for their pre-season training camp.
