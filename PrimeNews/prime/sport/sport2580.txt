Former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood has urged fans not to fret over Kyle Walker’s imminent £50million-plus move to Manchester City, insisting it’s ‘good for all parties’. England international Walker is expected to seal a big-money switch to the Etihad Stadium in the coming days after a fee of around £53m was reportedly agreed between the Premier League clubs. Some are questioning Spurs’ decision to allow one of their starting XI stars to leave for a direct rival – with many suggesting it only signals to other clubs that their best players are up for sale.
