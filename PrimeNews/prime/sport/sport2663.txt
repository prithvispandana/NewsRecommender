West Ham manager Slaven Bilic says he is 'pretty close' to adding to his squad. The Hammers have been linked with a move for England goalkeeper Joe Hart, who is out of favour at Manchester City and spent last season on loan with Torino. They are understood to have had a £20million bid for Stoke winger Marko Arnautovic turned down, and have reportedly dropped their interest in Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud.
