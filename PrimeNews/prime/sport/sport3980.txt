Deportivo La Coruna are leading the race for Everton goalkeeper Joel Robles. The Spaniard's place at Goodison Park is under threat following Jordan Pickford's Â£30m arrival from Sunderland and he is considering his future. Several sides in Spain are interested in the 27-year-old, including Getafe and Real Betis. But, according to Marca, Deportivo are the favourites to land Robles after missing out on other targets.
