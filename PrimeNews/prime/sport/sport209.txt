Turkish giants Fenerbahce are ready to test Everton's resolve in keeping hold of winger Kevin Mirallas. The Belgium international is understood to not be part of Ronald Koeman's long-term plans at Goodison Park and could well be on the move this summer. Mirallas, 29, had to contend with a place on the bench during much of the last campaign with Koeman often choosing to go with youth. And now, according to Turkish newspaper Fanatik, Fenerbahce are keeping tabs on the Belgian's situation and could be ready to launch a bid.
