Aberdeen were held to a 1-1 draw by Siroki Brijeg in the Europa League qualifying second round first leg. Stipo Markovic grabbed a crucial away goal for the Bosnian side to cancel out Ryan Christie's opener for the Dons at Pittodrie.  It left the tie delicately poised ahead of next week's second leg with Aberdeen now needing to score in Bosnia.  Christie opened the scoring after 17 minutes when he latched onto a long ball from goalkeeper Joe Lewis and curled into the corner.
