Juventus are hoping to tie up a deal for either Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic, the Manchester United target, or Liverpool's Emre Can. The Italian champions are looking to bolster their squad this summer after missing out on Champions League glory having lost to Real Madrid in the final. Juve boss Massimiliano Allegri has reportedly prioritised adding more strength to his midfield and he is pushing for a new player to be brought in.
