Everton have moved ahead of Sevilla in the race to sign Sampdoria's highly-rated forward Luis Muriel. The 26-year-old striker is expected to leave the Serie A side this summer, with La Liga giants Sevilla thought to be at the front of the queue for his signature. Reports have suggested that Muriel is excited by a potential move to Spain, but it appears Everton have made a last ditch attempt to lure the Columbia international to the Premier League.
