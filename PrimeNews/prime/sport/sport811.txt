With the summer transfer window officially open, the time has come for Tottenham to get their business done ahead of the Premier League season. So far, it has been rather quiet for the north London club, with Mauricio Pochettinoâ€™s side yet to add a single addition to a squad that finished as runners-up in the last campaign. Spurs are famous for recruiting in the final hours of transfer windows, however, there remains plenty of time to sign the names that Pochettino needs to turn his men from title challengers into potential champions.
