Fara Williams has won more England caps than Peter Shilton, but would give them all up for a winner's medal from the European Championship. Playmaker Williams has travelled to Holland as a key member of Mark Sampson's England Women squad, two years after starring as the Lionesses took third place at the World Cup. Since making her international debut in November 2001, Williams has gone close to tournament triumphs but fallen short each time, including when England were Euro 2009 runners-up.
