The only danger Tottenham have of losing Harry Kane is if Real Madrid make a move to sign the England striker. This is the opinion of former Spurs boss Tim Sherwood, who co-hosted the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast on Tuesday. Kane became just the fifth player to win the Premier League Golden Boot in successive years at the end of last season, having scored 29 league goals in just 30 games. The 23-year-old has netted 94 goals in all competitions across the last three seasons, and no one doubts he will continue his impressive scoring feats over the next few years.
