Stoke City have turned down Galatasaray's loan bid for midfielder Giannelli Imbula, according to reports. The 24-year-old's future at the Bet365 Stadium has been cast into some doubt after a disappointing campaign for the Potters. Imbula made the move to Stoke for a club record Â£18.3million from Porto last January but has failed to establish himself in the first-team setup. And, despite having four years left on his current contract, the Premier League club are considering cutting their losses and getting rid of the midfielder this summer.
