Jesse Lingard is determined to confound the doubters and repay Manchester United's faith, especially as he feared his Old Trafford dream might have been over a few years ago. Patience has been a key attribute for the homegrown player, with the late bloomer only making a first-team impact following several loan spells. Lingard has relished taking his chance at United and is now not only a fully established part of the squad but a big-game player, scoring in the recent FA Cup, EFL Cup and Community Shield triumphs.
