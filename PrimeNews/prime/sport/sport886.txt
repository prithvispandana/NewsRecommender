Lee Bowyer has been appointed as Charlton's assistant manager. The former England midfielder made his breakthrough as a player with the Addicks in the 1990s, before embarking on successful career that took in the likes of Leeds, Newcastle and West Ham. Now 40, Bowyer returned to Charlton on a temporary basis in January but boss Karl Robinson has moved to promote him to the position of his full-time assistant. "It feels great to be asked to do this and to work alongside Karl and I'm really looking forward to it," said Bowyer, who played 58 times for Charlton.
