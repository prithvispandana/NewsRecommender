Asmir Begovic hailed Eddie Howe as one of the most talented young managers in the world and a key factor in his decision to join Bournemouth from Chelsea. Begovic played with Howe when he first started out at Portsmouth in 2003 and then worked under him during a brief loan spell with the Cherries in 2007 after Howe had become a coach. Now Begovic is back at Bournemouth for the long-term and he says Howe, who has led the club from League Two to the Premier League, was the biggest motivating factor. "Eddie was a huge factor," Begovic said.
