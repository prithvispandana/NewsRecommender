With the 2017 UEFA Women's Championship finals to kick off this coming Sunday, it seems appropriate to indulge in the memory of Dick, Kerr’s Ladies FC – the most successful women’s football team in the world and once seen as the biggest threat to the men’s game. Founded in October 1917 in an ammunitions factory in Preston, for Dick, Kerr & Company, 11 factory workers made up the Dick, Kerr’s Ladies team that would raise money for the soldiers wounded in the First World War.
