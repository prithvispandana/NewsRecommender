Ben Brereton and Ryan Sessegnon each scored a brace as England reached the semi-finals of the European Under-19 Championship with a 4-1 victory over Germany in Georgia. Nottingham Forest forward Brereton's second-half double gave England a 2-0 lead and after Germany substitute Tobias Warschewski pulled one back with 14 minutes left, Fulham's Sessegnon added two late goals.
