Romelu Lukaku faces court action in the US over "excessive noise" at a residence in Beverly Hills, police said. The striker, who is on the verge of a Â£75 million move from Everton to Manchester United, was arrested on July 2 at around 8pm after being given verbal warnings by officers. A Beverly Hills Police Department statement, naming him as Romelu Lukaku Bolingoli, said the 24-year-old must appear at a Los Angeles courthouse in October.
