Aaron Lennon has returned to Everton for pre-season training. The former England winger was among the players pictured as the club posted a gallery of photographs of the squad returning to work after the summer break. Lennon, 30, was detained under the Mental Health Act in May. A statement from the club at the time said the player was "receiving care and treatment for a stress-related illness".
