Barcelona have announced they have activated their buy-back clause for Everton's Gerard Deulofeu, who will return to the Nou Camp on a two-year contract. The winger impressed for the Toffees while on loan during the 2013/14 season and was signed from the Catalan club permanently in 2015. However, Deulofeu fell out of favour with Ronald Koeman and was loaned out to AC Milan for the second half of last season. The 23-year-oldâ€™s performances at the San Siro were impressive and that has persuaded Barcelona to bring their youth academy graduate back the Nou Camp.
