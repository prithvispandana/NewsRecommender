Hughie Fury's WBO heavyweight title fight with defending champion Joseph Parker has been confirmed for September 23 at the Manchester Arena. The younger cousin of Tyson Fury bids to win one of the titles the 28-year-old won in 2015 against Wladimir Klitschko. He had been scheduled to challenge New Zealander Parker, 25, in Auckland on May 6 until injury forced his withdrawal a fortnight before. The development also comes while the Furys' hearing with UK-Anti Doping, relating to allegations they tested positively for nandrolone in 2015, is still to take place.
