Wakefield returned to winning ways with a gritty 26-12 victory that keeps them in touch with the top four and leaves Warrington deep in trouble at the other end of the Betfred Super League table. A 12th defeat of the season leaves last year's league leaders' shield winners three points adrift of the top eight with just three games left before the Super 8s and almost certainly consigns them to a relegation fight in the Qualifiers.
