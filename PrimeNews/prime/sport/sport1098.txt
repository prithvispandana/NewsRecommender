Manchester City have told Wilfried Bony he can go if someone coughs up £17.5m. The striker has fallen down the pecking order at the Etihad and he spent last season on loan at Stoke City. The Ivorian endured a difficult time there, though, and the Potters have decided against signing him permanently. That means Bony is on the hunt for a new club and, according to Foot Mercato, he can join one if they stump up £17.5m. That is the asking price City have set for the 28-year-old and they will not let him leave for anything less.
