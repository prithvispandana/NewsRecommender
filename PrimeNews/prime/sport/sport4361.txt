Danny Wilson insists he is ready to battle Bruno Alves and Fabio Cardoso for a slot in the Rangers defence. The former Scotland international made his return after three months out injured on Tuesday as Gers took on St Johnstone in a behind-closed-doors friendly. Pedro Caixinha's side sank to a narrow 1-0 loss at their Auchenhowie training base but the 45-minute run-out was a huge relief for Wilson as he prepares to fight for his place.
