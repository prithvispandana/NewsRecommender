England won the European Under-19 Championship title for the first time in their history after beating Portugal 2-1 in Saturday's final in Georgia. Aston Villa defender Easah Suliman headed the Young Lions in front early in the second half after a free-kick Mason Mount had hit the post. A sliced own-goal from Chelsea right-back Dujon Sterling saw Portugal level before the hour. Keith Downing's side, though, secured a memorable victory when Manchester City forward Lukas Nmecha swept in after 68 minutes following a powerful run from Mount down the right.
