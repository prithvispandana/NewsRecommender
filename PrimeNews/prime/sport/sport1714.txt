Geraint Thomas is out of the Tour de France after crashing on Sunday's stage nine from Nantua to Chambery, Team Sky have announced. The Welshman suffered a suspected broken collarbone in a crash on the descent of the Col de la Biche, the first of three hors categorie climbs on a day expected to shake up the battle for the yellow jersey. Team Sky tweeted: "Sadly @GeraintThomas86 has been forced to abandon #TDF2017 following that crash. More updates when we have them."
