Liverpool are willing to splurge £70million on RB Leipzig midfielder Naby Keita as they look to break their transfer record for the second time this summer. The Guinean international, who scored eight goals in the Bundesliga last season, is another target Reds boss Jurgen Klopp is desperate to capture ahead of their return to the Champions League. Keita’s expected arrival will give the Reds yet another attacking option to choose from as they look to add quality as well as depth to their current squad.
