Rangers suffered fresh humiliation as they crashed out of the Europa League following a 2-0 defeat to Luxembourg minnows Progres Niederkorn. The Ibrox side were hoping to show they had made steps forward after last season's troubled domestic campaign. But instead they found themselves suffering another nightmare and a result which will go down as one of their worst ever abroad. Not only had part-timers Niederkorn never won a match in European competition before, they had only managed one goal in 13 previous encounters.
