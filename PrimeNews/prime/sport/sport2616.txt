Roma have held talks with the agent of Leicester City star and Arsenal targetÂ Riyad Mahrez, according to reports in Italy. The winger wants to leave the King Power this summer after the club missed out on Champions League qualification last season. Arsenal have been linked with the Algerian, while French champions Monaco are also tracking his situation closely. But it is Roma who are seemingly the frontrunners at the moment and, according to Leggo, they have now held talks with Mahrez's agent.
