Revenge was sweet for Castleford as they held off a late fightback to beat third-placed Hull 24-22 to pull eight points clear at the top of the Betfred Super League with just three games left of the regular season. The Tigers are showing no signs of slowing up in their search for a first league title as they avenged their recent Challenge Cup defeat as well as one of only three league losses so far this year.
