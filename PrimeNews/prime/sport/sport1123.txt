St Helens scrum-half Matty Smith will undergo a second operation after suffering a horrific eye injury last week. The England international's eyelid was ripped and eyeball damaged after being accidentally caught in the face by the hand of teammate Jon Wilkin in a tackle. Smith, 29, has been cleared of any serious problems but Saints are unsure how long they will be without the influential half-back. Coach Justin Holbrook said: "It couldn't get stitched straight away because of the whole eyelid getting ripped open. It is not that clear-cut.
