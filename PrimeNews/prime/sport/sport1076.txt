Inter Milan have agreed personal terms with former Manchester United flop Angel Di Maria. The Argentina international previously spent one season at Old Trafford, before joining Paris Saint-Germain for around £44million in July 2015. The 29-year-old, who cost Manchester United a British record £59.7m in 2014, has been back to his best in France. Di Maria's performances have now alerted big-spending Inter and, according to reports in Italy, they have accelerated talks to agree personal terms with him.
