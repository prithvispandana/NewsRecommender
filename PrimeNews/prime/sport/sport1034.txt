Saint Etienne have joined Bournemouth and Brighton in the race for Dijon striker Lois Diony. The Frenchman caught the eye in Ligue 1 last season after finding the net 11 times and also weighing in with eight assists. Dijon are well aware of the growing interest in the 24-year-old and they will let him go if someone meets their Â£13million asking price. Earlier on in the summer Bournemouth had been linked with Diony, while more recently he has been on the radars of Brighton and Birmingham City.
