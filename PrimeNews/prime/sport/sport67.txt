Chelsea are rumoured to be on the verge of signing Juventus fullback Alex Sandro for a club-record Â£61million. The Brazilian defender caught the eye for the Old Lady as they secured the Serie A title and progressed to the Champions League final against Real Madrid. Antonio Conte is set to raid his former club as he attempts to launch a credible challenge on both domestic and European fronts. Sandro will be joining fellow Brazilians David Luiz, Willian and Kenedy at Stamford Bridge, at a club that has always valued South American talent.
