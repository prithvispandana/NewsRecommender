Former Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina is wanted by Manchester City to replace the unwanted Claudio Bravo at the Etihad.  Reina is open to a move back to the Premier League, even if it is as understudy to Ederson, the £35million signing from Benfica, according to The Times.   The Spain international is close to Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta who recently joined City's coaching staff. Reina is expected to command fee of around £5million from Napoli, who finished third in last season Serie A.
