Newcastle have reportedly offered out-of-favour forward Aleksandar Mitrovic to Lyon if they cough up £16m to sign him. The Serbia international has been linked with a move away from St. James' Park this summer, with the newly-promoted side ready to offload him for the right price. And, according to Foot Mercato, Lyon have been offered the chance to sign the Newcastle misfit for a fee of £16m.
