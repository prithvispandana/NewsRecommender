Chelsea have agreed a Â£40million move for Manchester United target Tiemoue Bakayoko, who will pen a five-year deal at Stamford Bridge. According to French outlet RMC, the deal is done, with a medical booked in for Friday ahead of the official completion of the transfer. French champions Monaco have finally accepted the offer from Chelsea, who made Bakayoko one of their top targets earlier this summer. It will come as bad news for United, who have also been extensively linked with the young Frenchman during this window.
