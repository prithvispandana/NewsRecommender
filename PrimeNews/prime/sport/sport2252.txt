Chelsea have received a huge boost with reports that Eden Hazard has turned down a move to Real Madrid this summer. The Spanish giants have been strongly linked with a move for the Belgian ace, who has been one of the Premier League’s brightest stars since joining Chelsea in 2012. But, according to Diario Gol, Hazard phoned Real manager Zinedine Zidane to tell him he plans to stay at Stamford Bridge for at least one more season. However, it is also claimed the Blues star refused to rule out a move to the Bernabeu during his conversation with the French legend.
