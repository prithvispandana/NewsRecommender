Turkish champions Besiktas have set their sights on out-of-favour Manchester City defender Eliaquim Mangala to partner new signing Pepe at the heart of their defence. Portugal international Pepe joined Besiktas last month and the Istanbul giants are looking to sign another big-name centre half as they prepare for a return to Champions League action next season. And, according to Fanatik, Mangala sits top of their list of transfer targets, with Besiktas in talks with City over a potential deal.
