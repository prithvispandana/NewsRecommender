Chelsea could miss out on another transfer target with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ready to push through a move to AC Milan. The striker is prepared to leave Borussia Dortmund this summer and he almost joined Chinese side Tianjin Quanjian recently. That deal would have banked the Gabon international a wage of over £500,000-a-week but it collapsed before the Chinese transfer window closed on Friday.
