Sevilla have had a £5.25million bid for Aston Villa defender Jordan Amavi rejected – but they are ready to return with a fresh offer. The Spanish club are in the market for a new left-back this summer and they have earmarked the 23-year-old as their number one target. Indeed Sevilla, according to Estadio Deportivo, submitted an offer of £5.25m last week as they look to get a deal over the line quickly. However, that approach was rejected by Aston Villa and Sevilla have been forced to work on a new proposal.
