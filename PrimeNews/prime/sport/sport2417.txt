Kyle Walker is off to Man City, according to reports. The club are believed to have agreed a Â£50m fee with Tottenham for the right-back, who is expected to have a medical at the club on Friday. Although Spurs fans are not surprised by the deal, it is still hard to stomach seeing one of your best players join a Premier League rival. As a result some supporters have been expressing their belief on Twitter that Kieran Trippier is a better option.
