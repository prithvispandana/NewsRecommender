Lukas Nmecha scored three minutes into added time to send England’s Under-19s into the final of the European Championship. The Manchester City forward came off the bench to net with virtually the last kick of the game. It came after good work from Tottenham’s Marcus Edwards on the right, and his pass inside found Nmecha on the edge of the six-yard box, with his brilliantly-crafted backheel beating Czech Republic goalkeeper Martin Jedlicka.
