Pepe Reina remains a highly capable goalkeeper and Manchester City are keen on adding the former Liverpool man to their ranks. According to reports the Spaniard is open to a move back to England from Napoli even if it means serving as a back-up to newly acquired stopper Ederson at the Etihad. Unsurprisingly Liverpool fans have had much to say about one of their favourite players turning out for a rival.
