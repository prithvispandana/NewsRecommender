Wigan recorded their first Super League win since April as they were pushed all the way by Widnes in a 28-12 victory. Defeat against the Vikings would have all but ended the champions' hopes of being at Old Trafford in October, but they managed to dig deep and take the points. Wigan led 16-6 at the break, and although they were not at their fluent best they were much the better team as they outscored Widnes three tries to one.
