Paul Coughlin will take over from Paul Collingwood as Durham captain in this season's NatWest T20 Blast. The 24-year-old seamer, from Sunderland, has played just 16 T20 matches in his career but has already served as Collingwood's vice-captain in the Royal London One-Day Cup. "It's an honour to captain the club in any format. From growing up, it's what I've always wanted to do," said Coughlin, who will lead the team for the first time in Friday's home match with Lancashire.
