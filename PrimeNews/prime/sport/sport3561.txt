Dan Ashworth has been delighted with the success enjoyed by England teams this summer and believes it is a good platform for the Football Association to build on. England have claimed a number of prestigious titles at youth level over the past month, with the boys winning the Under-20 World Cup, the Under-20 Toulon Tournament and the European Under-19 Championship, while the women's Under-23 team also prevailed in the Nordic Tournament.
