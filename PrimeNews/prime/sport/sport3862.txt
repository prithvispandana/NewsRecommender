West Ham flop Sofiane Feghouli is reportedly on the verge of completing a move to Turkish giants Galatasaray. Feghouli, 27, struggled during his first season in the Premier League making 27 appearances in all competitions and netting just four times. And, according to Turkish news outlet Fanatik, the Algeria international is expected in Istanbul this week to finalise the transfer. The move could be completed by the end of the week, as Hammers boss Slaven Bilic reshuffles his squad after an underwhelming campaign last season.
