Roma have told Chelsea target Kostas Manolas to either join Zenit St. Petersburg or be prepared to stay where he is. The defender is in talks with Zenit over a move to Russia after they had a Â£26million offer accepted. The Greece international was due to rubber-stamp the deal on Wednesday, but a dispute over his wages has caused negotiations to stall.
