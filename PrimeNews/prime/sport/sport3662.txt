Douglas Costa has revealed he joined Juventus as Serie A is the 'perfect' league for him. The winger has signed for the Italian champions from Bayern Munich on a season-long loan for an initial fee of £5.3m, but he can join them permanently for £35.4m next summer. Prior to joining Juventus, Costa had been heavily linked with a move to either Manchester City or Manchester United. The Premier League big hitters had been scouting the 26-year-old towards the end of last season and there was talk they would swoop this summer.
