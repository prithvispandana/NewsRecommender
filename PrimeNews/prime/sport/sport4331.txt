Sevilla are the latest club to express an interest in Manchester City defender Eliaquim Mangala. The 26-year-old is set to leave the Etihad this summer as he no longer features in manager Pep Guardiola's plans. Turkish champions Besiktas are very interested in the Frenchman and are willing to take him on loan for the year.
