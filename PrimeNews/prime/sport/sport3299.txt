Former Manchester United striker Teddy Sheringham has told talkSPORT Romelu Lukaku will need to change his game to fit in at Old Trafford. The Belgian star played his first 45 minutes for the Red Devils on Sunday morning as they beat LA Galaxy 5-2 in their first pre-season friendly of the summer. It was a fairly uneventful performance from the £75million buy, with his shooting a little rusty, but he appeared to link well with the likes of Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Paul Pogba as he held the ball up for his team-mates.
