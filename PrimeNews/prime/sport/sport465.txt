Top clubs from around Europe are now chasing the 23-year-old, especially as he has just two years to run on his current contract. But the attacking midfielder, who is on Tottenham's radar this summer, has now dealt them and other chasing sides a hammer blow by revealing he plans to stay at the San Siro.
