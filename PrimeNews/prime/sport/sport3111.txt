England surrendered a yawning advantage to South Africa on a manic second day at Trent Bridge. The hosts, hoping to consolidate here after their wide-margin win at Lord's, will have to do so the very hard way after being bowled out for 205 to concede a first-innings deficit of 130 in this second Investec Test. South Africa then extended their lead to 205 with a stumps total of 75 for one, as a curiously serene late passage of play broke the mould and yielded a solitary wicket in a daily tally of 15.
