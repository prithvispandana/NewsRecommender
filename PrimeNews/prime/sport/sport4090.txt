Manager Antonio Conte has signed a new two-year contract with Chelsea. The Italian guided the Blues to the Premier League title in his first season at Stamford Bridge. "I am very happy to have signed a new contract with Chelsea. We worked extremely hard in our first year to achieve something amazing, which I am very proud of. Now we must work even harder to stay at the top," Conte said on the club's official website. Conte penned a three-year deal on his appointment last summer after leading Italy into the European Championships.
