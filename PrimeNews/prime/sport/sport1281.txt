Tammy Abraham has joined Swansea on a season-long loan from Chelsea. The 19-year-old striker signed a new five-year contract with the Premier League champions on Tuesday before sealing his temporary switch to the Swans. Abramah, who was also wanted by Newcastle, was a man in-demand after a hugely succesful loan spell in the Championship with Bristol City last season.
