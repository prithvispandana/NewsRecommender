Newcastle have announced the signing of winger Jacob Murphy from Norwich for an undisclosed fee. The Magpies had an increased offer for Murphy accepted on Tuesday, reported to be Â£12.5million, and the England Under-21 international has now become their third summer signing. "He's a young and talented player and hopefully he can develop even more here," Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez told the club's official website. Neither club has disclosed the fee nor the length of contract for Murphy, 22, who enjoyed his breakthrough season at Norwich last season.
