Lazio have told Chelsea, Everton and Manchester United they can sign Keita Balde Diao this summer – if they cough up £22m. The forward is currently refusing to sign a new contract despite holding talks over fresh terms since January. Lazio had hoped they would eventually convince the Senegal international to stay, but interest from elsewhere has turned his head. The Italian club are now ready to cash in on Diao this summer and, according to Sky Italia, they have set their asking price at £22m.
