Spanish side Celta Vigo are interested in taking Manchester City outcast Nolito back to the club this summer, according to reports in Spain. The 30-year-old is unsettled in England and has expressed his desire to leave City in order to rejuvenate his career. While the weather in England remains an issue behind his desire to leave, Nolito has also suffered from a lack of playing time at the Etihad Stadium. Nolito managed 30 appearances for Pep Guardiola's side last term, but he clocked just 166 minutes of playing time after the turn of the year.
