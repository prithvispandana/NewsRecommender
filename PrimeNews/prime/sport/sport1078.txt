Derby County have confirmed the signing of defender Andre Wisdom from Liverpool on a four-year deal. The two clubs had already agreed a fee for the 24-year-old, believed to be in the region of Â£3million, and were just waiting for the player to return from his summer holiday and complete a medical before making the transfer final. Wisdom returns to the Rams having spent the 2013/14 season on loan with the Championship club, where he made 38 appearances in an impressive campaign.
