Moeen Ali's career-best bowling helped Joe Root start his tenure as Test captain with a resounding 211-run victory inside four days as 19 wickets fell in three remarkable sessions at Lord's. Jonny Bairstow also bailed out England with a defiant half-century, after a collapse of seven wickets for 43 runs, and then kickstarted South Africa's descent to 119 all out with an athletic leg-side catch as their attempt to pull off the ground's second-highest run chase veered instead on to the fast track to defeat.
