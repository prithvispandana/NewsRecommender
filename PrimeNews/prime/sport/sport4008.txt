Gary Ballance's availability for the third Test at The Oval appears in significant doubt as England determine the extent of his finger injury. Ballance was hit on the left index finger by Morne Morkel in the second innings of England's defeat against South Africa at Trent Bridge. He will see a hand surgeon in Leeds on Tuesday evening, the England and Wales Cricket Board announced. Ballance did not initially think he had broken his finger and, after treatment on the field, was able to resume his innings.
