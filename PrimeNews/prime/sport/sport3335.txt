Switzerland's Roger Federer has won a record eighth Wimbledon men's singles title by beating Croatian Marin Cilic 6-3 6-1 6-4 in the final. It took the 35-year-old just an hour and 41 minutes to clinch by far his most one-sided Wimbledon final triumph and extend his overall record with a 19th grand slam singles title. The victory continues Federer's magnificent season in what should be his tennis dotage but even the most ardent of the Swiss' fans - and there were many packed into Centre Court - did not want the final to play out like this.
