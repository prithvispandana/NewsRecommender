Join Andy Goldstein and Jason Cundy for the best bits of Thursday's Sports Bar show. On today's show, Andy and Jason have a mass debate over Kyle Walker....and his £50million move to Man City. Why is he leaving – will this start a domino effect/exodus from Spurs? And, with Nathaniel Chalobah turning down Chelsea for Watford – do the Blues see these players as just profit? PLUS, there's the latest edition of 'Truth or Lies'!
