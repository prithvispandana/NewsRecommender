Joe Hart will be a success for West Ham should the east London club manage to finalise a deal for the Manchester City outcast this summer, according to former Hammer David James. It has been reported in the last few days that the Hammers want to finalise a deal for England international Hart in the next few days, taking him to the London Stadium on a season-long loan with the option to make the deal permanent at the end of the 2017/18 season.
