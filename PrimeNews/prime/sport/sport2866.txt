Conor McGregor has told talkSPORT he is not nervous to face Floyd Mayweather when the pair clash in the 180 Million Dollar Dance in August. The UFC Lightweight champion has opted to change sports to take up the challenge of Mayweather, who is going for his 50th win in a career which has seen the 40-year-old never lose a bout. Both fighters are to be extremely financially rewarded for the fight, though it has been criticised in some quarters for just how much of a farce the idea of the clash is.
