Sampdoria want Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere and are willing to offer the Gunners £9million to take him to Serie A.  Enquiries have been made about Wilshere’s availability but Sampdoria fear their valuation may be short of what Arsenal want, according to the Daily Mail.  The England international is now moving into the final 12 months of his contract with no sign of a new deal on the horizon.
