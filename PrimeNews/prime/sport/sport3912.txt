Liverpool's out-of-favour winger Lazar Markovic is mulling over the possibility of a return to the Turkish Super League. The 23-year-old, who spent last season out on loan at Sporting Lisbon and then Hull City, is set to leave Anfield this summer in search of regular first-team football. With competition for places so high at Liverpool, the Serbia international is reportedly interesting Besiktas, who have made initial contact with the winger's representatives.
