Johanna Konta has become the first British woman since Jo Durie in 1984 to reach the quarter-finals of Wimbledon. The sixth seed defeated Caroline Garcia 7-6 (7/3) 4-6 6-4 in a thriller on Court One to continue her dream run at SW19. Garcia had beaten Konta, also in three sets, at Indian Wells in March but she is yet to beat a top-10 player at a grand slam and this time it was Konta's serve, and nerve, that came up trumps.
