Michay Batshuayi is not good enough for Chelsea right now and still needs time to develop into a player who can star for the Blues. That is the opinion of former Stamford Bridge favourite Celestine Babayaro, who was speaking exclusively to talkSPORT at the Star Sixes event in London. Batshuayi is Chelseaâ€™s most senior forward heading into the start of the 2017/18 campaign, with Diego Costa expected to leave west London and Loic Remy nowhere to be found.
