Former Sutton United goalkeeper Wayne Shaw has been charged in relation to breaching two Football Association rules.Â  The 45-year-old is alleged to have intentionally influenced a betting market after he ate a pie on the sidelines during Sutton's 2-0 FA Cup defeat to Arsenal in February, the FA has announced. A bookmaker had offered odds of 8-1 Shaw would eat a pie on camera. He has also alleged to have brought the game into disrepute.
