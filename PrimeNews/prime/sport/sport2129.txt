Novak Djokovic's hopes of winning a fourth Wimbledon title were scuppered by injury after the Serbian was forced to retire against Tomas Berdych. Djokovic had lost the first set in a tie-break and was down a break in the second when he withdrew from his quarter-final, with Berdych up 7-6 (7/2) 2-0. Berdych will face 18-time grand slam champion Roger Federer for a place in the final on Sunday. Swiss star Federer beatÂ Milos Raonic in straight sets.
