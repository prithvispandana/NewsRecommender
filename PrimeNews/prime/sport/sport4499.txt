West Ham are closing in on the signing of Bayer Leverkusen striker Javier Hernandez, according to reports. The Hammers look to have settled on the former Manchester United forward after failing to lure the likes of Olivier Giroud, Michy Batshuayi and Kelechi Iheanacho to the London Stadium. Hernandez, Mexico’s leading all-time goal scorer, is entering the final year of his contract with the Bundesliga club and has a £13million release clause, which the Hammers are ready to activate.
