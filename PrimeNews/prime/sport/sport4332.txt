Liverpool fans have been getting excited over new signing Dominic Solanke. The 19-year-old, a summer arrival from Chelsea, opened his account for the club in their 2-0 Barclays Asia Cup win over Crystal Palace in Hong Kong. It was a well-taken strike, as Solanke let the ball run across his body on the edge of the box before instinctively firing low into the back of the net.
