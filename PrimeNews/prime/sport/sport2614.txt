It’s been a thrilling eight seasons, but Kyle Walker’s time at Tottenham is set to end with him becoming the world’s most expensive defender. Signed from Sheffield United as part of a £9million double deal, along with Kyle Naughton, he now departs to Manchester City in a £50million move. The 27-year-old leaves Spurs with some wonderful memories, including a north London derby goal, a cracker against West Ham, a superb free-kick against Manchester United, and some pretty funny YouTube pranks.
