England’s youth sides have seen plenty of action this summer, and been pretty successful too. It started well when our Under-17 reached the final of the European Championships, before losing to Spain on penalties. But our Under-20 side went one better, winning the World Cup, beating Venezuela in the final. Just when you thought it couldn’t get much better, our Toulon Tournament side, made up from Under-18s, Under-19, and Under-20s, won that competition too.
