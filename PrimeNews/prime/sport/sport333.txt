Leeds' youngsters rose superbly to the occasion to help the Rhinos to a tense 24-22 victory over St Helens that keeps them firmly on course for the Betfred Super League semi-finals. England internationals Kallum Watkins and Ryan Hall got the all-important tries in the last 16 minutes that enabled Leeds to come from 16-12 down, but the 2015 champions were hugely indebted to young guns Jack Walker and Jordan Lilley in helping them overcome the absence of seven senior players through injury and suspension.
