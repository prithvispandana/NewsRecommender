Watford have completed the signing of Nathaniel Chalobah from Chelsea. The midfielder has signed a five-year deal at Vicarage Road and has joined for an undisclosed fee. Chalobah has played 97 times for England at different youth levels and played in the Under-21s' run to the semi-final of the European Championships in Poland last month. He has returned to Watford after previously spending the 2012-13 season on loan, making 42 appearances and scoring five goals, as the Hornets lost the Sky Bet Championship play-off final.
