Galatasaray have joined Watford in the race for Lille defender Sebastien Corchia. The France international is into the final year of his current contract at the French club and he is no closer to signing an extension. Lille would like the 26-year-old to agree fresh terms, but if he refuses to do so they may well cash in on him now. Watford are very interested in Corchia and they are said to have made a formal approach for him. But, according to L'Equipe, Galatasaray are now also vying for the right-back and have made an offer of their own.
