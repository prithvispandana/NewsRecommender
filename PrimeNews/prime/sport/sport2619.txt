Scottish champions Celtic are nowhere near the level of the Premier League and would even struggle in the Championship, according to former Arsenal star Perry Groves. Last season, Brendan Rodgers' side became the first Scottish team since Rangers in 1899 to end their league campaign undefeated â€“ finishing a whole 30 points clear of runners-up Aberdeen. A debate over whether Celtic and Old Firm rivals Rangers could move over to English football has been raging for years, with many calling for a merge at one point when both were at the peak of their recent rivalry.
