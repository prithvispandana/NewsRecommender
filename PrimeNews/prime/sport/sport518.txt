The agent of Liverpool target Kasper Dolberg has admitted his client would find it difficult to turn down a potential move to Roma. Dolberg, 19, was in superb form for Ajax last term as he helped the Amsterdam side reach the final of the Europa League, with Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp hailing the youngster as "fantastic". Despite Ajax's reluctance to sell the Dane, Roma have pressed forward with their advances and reports have emerged that the Serie A giants lodged a Â£13m bid.
