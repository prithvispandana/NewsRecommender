Leeds turned on the style against Salford to leapfrog them into second place in the Super League with a clinical 50-24 victory at the AJ Bell Stadium. Winger Tom Briscoe scored two of the Rhinos' nine tries, seven of which came in the first half as the visitors established an unassailable 36-6 lead and comfortably withstood a second-half fightback from the Red Devils to secure a 14th win of the season.
