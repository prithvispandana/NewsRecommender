Rafael Nadal cruised into the second round of Wimbledon but fifth seed Stan Wawrinka suffered a shock loss to Russian Daniil Medvedev. This is the only grand slam Wawrinka has yet to win and he must try again next year after a 6-4 3-6 6-4 6-1 defeat. The Swiss, who arrived at the All England Club fresh from reaching the final of the French Open, called the trainer to ice his left knee and did not look comfortable throughout.
