Germany eased into the Confederations Cup final following a comfortable 4-1 victory over Mexico in Sochi. Joachim Low's youthful side overpowered Mexico as Leon Goretzka's early brace and second-half strikes from Timo Werner and Amin Younes sealed a place in Sunday's final with Chile in St Petersburg. Marco Fabian scored a fantastic late consolation goal for Mexico to briefly make it 3-1, but the world champions were too good. Germany started the match on the front foot and needed only six minutes to take the lead after they counter-attacked to devastating effect.
