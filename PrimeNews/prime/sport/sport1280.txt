Juventus will reject all offers for Chelsea target Alex Sandro…unless he demands to leave. The left-back is on Antonio Conte's summer shopping list this summer as the Italian looks to strengthen his squad. Chelsea have already reportedly had a £52.5million bid rejected for the Brazilian, with Juventus holding out for £61m instead. But now, according to Tuttosport, the Italian champions will also not sanction a deal unless Sandro explicitly demands to go. Juventus are desperate to keep the full-back and they have offered him a new deal with improved terms.
