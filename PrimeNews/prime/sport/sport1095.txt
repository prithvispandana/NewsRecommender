It happens all too often in boxing these days… fighters avoid each other until the ‘perfect time’ in their careers. By this point, when a pair finally cash in and face each other at the ‘perfect time’, their fight has usually diminished somewhat and never seems to live up to expectations. However, on Saturday July 8, undefeated British light-welterweights Josh Taylor and Ohara Davies are bucking this trend and will do battle after a combined total of just 24 fights on a FREE show, broadcast live on Channel 5. You just can’t miss this one.
