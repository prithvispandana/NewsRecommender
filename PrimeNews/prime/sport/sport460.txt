Former Liverpool star Pepe Reina is set to stay at Napoli this summer – despite interest from Newcastle. The goalkeeper has been discussing a new deal with the Italian club as his current contract is due to expire in a year. However, an agreement has not been reached and Newcastle have since offered the player the chance to join them this summer. Napoli, however, do not want to let Reina leave – even though they run the risk of losing him for free in a year.
