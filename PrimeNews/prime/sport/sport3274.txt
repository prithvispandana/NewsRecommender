Marcus Rashford scored twice as Manchester United began their pre-season tour of America with a 5-2 win against LA Galaxy. Romelu Lukaku and Victor Lindelof also made their first appearances for the club in a game United bossed from the outset. Manager Jose Mourinho named a different line-up in each half, with Marouane Fellaini also scoring in the first 45 minutes and Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Anthony Martial scoring the others.
