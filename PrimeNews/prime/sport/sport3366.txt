Sevilla have announced the signing of Nolito from Manchester City. The Spain forward has agreed a three-year deal and returns to LaLiga after one disappointing season at the Etihad Stadium. Sevilla are reported to have paid £7.9million for the 30-year-old, who joined Pep Guardiola's City for £13.8million from Celta Vigo last summer. Nolito, often playing in a wide midfield role, scored five goals in his first nine appearances for City but fell down the pecking order as Leroy Sane shone in the second half of the campaign.
