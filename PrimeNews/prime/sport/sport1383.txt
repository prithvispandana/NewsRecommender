Rangers have suffered what is perhaps the most embarrassing defeat in their history having been knocked out of the Europa League by Progres Niederkorn. The part-timers finished fourth in the Luxembourg top division last season, but managed to claim a 2-1 aggregate win over Pedro Caixinha's side. Tonight, two second half goals from Niederkorn gave them a 2-0 home victory - their first ever win in Europe - after the Gers won 1-0 at Ibrox last week.
