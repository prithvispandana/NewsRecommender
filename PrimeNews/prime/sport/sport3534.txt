Theo Walcott insists he would welcome the arrival of more forward players at Arsenal this summer. The 28-year-old lost his place in Arsene Wenger’s starting XI towards the end of the last season and is facing a fight to earn a regular spot this term. Wenger has brought in forward Alexandre Lacazette this summer for a club record transfer fee and is also chasing another wideman, with Monaco’s Thomas Lemar on his radar.
