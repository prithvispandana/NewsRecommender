Turkish giants Besiktas are planning an audacious swoop on wantaway Chelsea striker Diego Costa. The Spain international looks set to leave Stamford Bridge this summer after reports claimed that manager Antonio Conte had told the striker he wasn't part of his plans. Costa's initial desire is a return to former club Atletico Madrid, but due to their transfer ban the Spaniard would be unable to play until January. This has left the door wide open and, according to Fanatik, Besiktas are in talks with Costa's agent over an initial short-term loan deal.
