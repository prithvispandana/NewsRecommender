England under-21 striker Tammy Abraham says he has signed a five-year contract with Chelsea prior to his anticipated season-long loan to Swansea. The 19-year-old, who scored 26 goals on loan at Championship side Bristol City last season, announced his new deal on Twitter - although moments later the message was deleted. He had written: "Happy to sign a new 5 year contract with @ChelseaFC." Abraham has been linked with loan moves to Brighton, Newcastle and Celtic, but Swansea appear to have won the battle for his signature.
