Sebastian Vettel was accused of deliberately driving into his title rival Lewis Hamilton as this year's Formula One championship burst into life during a dramatic Azerbaijan Grand Prix. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo won what will be regarded as a race for the ages following three safety car periods, one red flag and a series of notable incidents. But it is Hamilton's clash with Vettel which will be the main talking point after the Ferrari driver was hit with a penalty for colliding twice with the Briton.
