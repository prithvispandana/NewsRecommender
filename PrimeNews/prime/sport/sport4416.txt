Pep Guardiola still wants to make as many as four more summer signings, with the Manchester City manager confirming interest in Real Madrid right-back Danilo. An outstanding start to life in the Premier League last season soon tapered off as the Spaniard's first campaign at the Etihad Stadium ended trophyless. Guardiola has overseen major surgery ahead of the 2017-18 season, with a number of players heading for the City exit in a summer that has seen Bernardo Silva, Ederson Moraes and Kyle Walker arrive. City are not done there, though.
