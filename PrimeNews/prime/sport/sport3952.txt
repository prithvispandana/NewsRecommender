Everton are ready to activate the £26.5m release-clause of Las Palmas star Jonathan Viera. The Toffees are undertaking a major recruitment drive this summer and boss Ronald Koeman wants to add a creative playmaker to their ranks. Everton had been chasing Swansea City's Gylfi Sigurdsson, but they appear to have been put off by the Welsh club's £50million asking price. And, according to reports in Spain, Everton are now ready to swoop for Viera instead of the Iceland star.
