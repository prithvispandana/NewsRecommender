Manchester City will pay £55,000-a-week toward Joe Hart's wages to push through his move to West Ham. The unwanted keeper is heading to the London Stadium where he will pick up an additional £120,000-a-week to make him, by far, the best-paid Hammers player. The payment from City comes as part of his image rights deal with the club, despite not having played for them since August last year, accoriding to The Sun.  Hart will sign a one-year loan deal with the east London club after completing his medical on Monday.
