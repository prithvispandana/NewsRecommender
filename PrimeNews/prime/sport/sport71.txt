The latest shock transfer rumour has linked Harry Kane with a mega-money move to Manchester United. The Tottenham striker is admired by Jose Mourinho, who wants to bring him to Old Trafford no matter the cost. Spurs have no desire to sell their club hero, but United are reportedly going to test the water with a bid of around £100 million. Should this move go through, it could be just one of many transfers involving two Premier League teams.
