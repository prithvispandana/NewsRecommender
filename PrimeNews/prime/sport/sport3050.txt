Arsene Wenger has made it clear Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will ‘100 per cent’ say at Arsenal this summer despite rumours linking the England winger with a move away from the Emirates. The 23-year-old is reportedly keen on leaving the Gunners to kickstart his career, with a host of clubs including Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City interested in him. Oxlade-Chamberlain is said to be frustrated by his contract situation in north London, with no progress made on talks concerning a new deal, with his current one expiring at the end of the 2017/18 campaign.
