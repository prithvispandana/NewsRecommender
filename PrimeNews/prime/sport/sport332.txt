Georgie Bingham and Ben Kay are joined by Justin Marshall and Phil Vickery to preview the British and Irish Lions’ second Test against New Zealand. The panel reflect on Warren Gatland’s side’s first Test defeat at Eden Park, discuss team selection and Sam Warburton’s return to the starting XV, and ask whether the Lions players are showing enough respect to match officials.
