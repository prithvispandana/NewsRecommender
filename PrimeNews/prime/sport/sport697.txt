Jermain Defoe admits his decision to complete a 'dream'Â return to Bournemouth was all-but made when his mum Sandra gave her approval to the move. The 34-year-old enjoyed a prolific loan spell with the Cherries as a teenager - scoring 10 goals in as many games, which still stands as a club record. In all the striker hit 19 goals during the 2001-02 season at a time when Bournemouth were in the third tier of English football.
