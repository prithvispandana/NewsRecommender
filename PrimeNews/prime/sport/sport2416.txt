Johanna Konta's Wimbledon dream went up in smoke as she was beaten in the semi-finals by an inspired Venus Williams. Konta was hoping to become Britain's first female singles champion in 40 years at SW19 but Williams proved a class above and sealed a 6-4 6-2 victory. The British number one had two break points at the end of the opening set but failed to capitalise and instead it was Williams who broke the very next game. The American never looked back.
