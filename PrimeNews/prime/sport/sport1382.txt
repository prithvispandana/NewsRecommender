Catalans Dragons will be without three players through suspension for the crucial visit of Wigan on Saturday. Second rower Ben Garcia was handed a two-match ban for running in and punching during the Dragons' stormy 40-36 Super League win over Leigh last Saturday. Loose forward Greg Bird was given a one-game suspension after pleading guilty to punching and winger Fouad Yaha was banned for one match for running in and punching.
