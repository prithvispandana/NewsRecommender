Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson has announced his retirement from professional football. The 37-year-old - who won 41 caps for the Three Lions - has called it quits after his contract at Burnley expired. Robinson has spent the past 18 months at Turf Moor as back-up to Tom Heaton, playing just three times for the Clarets. He previously spent seven years at Blackburn, during which time had made more than 200 appearances across all competitions. Robinson also had successful spells at Tottenham and Leeds United earlier in his career.
