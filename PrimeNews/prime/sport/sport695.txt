Saul Niguez has put an end to speculation over his future by signing a new NINE-YEAR contract with Atletico Madrid. The 22-year-old midfielder is widely regarded as one of the best young players on the planet. He has been a regular for the LaLiga giants over the past three years and enhanced his reputation this summer with some stunning performances for Spain Under-21s at Euro 2017. Niguez's impressive form has seen him catch the attention of other elite clubs across Europe, including Barcelona and Manchester United.
