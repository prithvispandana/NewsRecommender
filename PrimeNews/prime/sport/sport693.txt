Roma have asked Liverpool to name their price for unwanted left-back Alberto Moreno, according to reports in Italy. The 24-year-old Spaniard spent most of last season on the substitute’s bench after losing his place in the side to James Milner and looks certain to leave Anfield this summer. Reports have suggested Roma’s newly appointed Director of Football, Monchi, has set his sights on the former Sevilla defender and plans to bring him to the Stadio Olimpico.
