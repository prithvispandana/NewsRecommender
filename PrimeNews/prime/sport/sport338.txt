Juventus have confirmed the release of Dani Alves, paving the way for a possible reunion with Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. The 34-year-old Brazilian right-back, who played under Guardiola at Barcelona, announced earlier this week he was leaving the Serie A champions. City have been linked heavily with the player since releasing right-backs Pablo Zabaleta and Bacary Sagna at the end of last season.
