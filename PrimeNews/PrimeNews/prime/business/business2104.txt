NRG Energy Inc. rose the most in almost nine years on news that it will sell off as much as $4 billion in assets, including potentially all of its renewable energy business. The company has been under pressure from Elliott Management Corp., its fourth-largest shareholder, to cut costs. The share climb Wednesday increases the value of Elliottâ€™s stake in NRG to about $352 million.
