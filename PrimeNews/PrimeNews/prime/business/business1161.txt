Martin Shkreli is a former hedge fund manager, pharmaceutical executive and a social media star. He gained infamy by hiking the price of a potentially life-saving drug by 5,000 percent, was dragged before a government committee where he refused to speak and now is on trial, accused of ripping off his investors in a Ponzi-like scheme.
