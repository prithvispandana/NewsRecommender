An exclusive look at the latest short from Neill Blomkamp's Oats Studios. Zygote stars Dakota Fanning and Jose Pablo Cantillo, and will be released for free on Oats Studios YouTube, Steam, and Facebook channels on July 12th. Oats Studios is a new experimental filmmaking "lab". The Studio is an independent incubator of ideas that has the capacity to handle all aspects of production from start to end. Oats Studios works in an open source format with the audience by allowing the fans to interact with the filmmakers and the studio directly and allowing the fans access to the actual film's assets to then merge with their own creativity.
