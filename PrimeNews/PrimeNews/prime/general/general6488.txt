PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) â€” Where is the character Rey in the "Star Wars" version of Monopoly? In a land far, far away, apparently. Eighteen months after game-maker Hasbro promised to add the female character to the game by the fall of 2016, the Illinois girl who wrote to them to say "girls matter" is still waiting. Others are, too. After inquiries from The Associated Press this week, Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based Hasbro said it made the piece but didn't release the new version in the United States "due to insufficient interest." People who bought the all-male game can request a Rey from customer service, spokeswoman Julie Duffy said Wednesday.
