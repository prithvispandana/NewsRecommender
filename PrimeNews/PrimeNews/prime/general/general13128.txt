CHESHIRE, Conn. (AP) â€” It's a day seared into the memories of all involved: The July 23, 2007, home invasion in which two paroled burglars broke into a Cheshire, Connecticut, home after dark, terrorized the family for hours and killed a woman and her two daughters. The viciousness of the crime upended notions of suburban security, delayed the abolition of Connecticut's death penalty, and became the subject of TV shows, documentaries and books. It drew comparisons to the 1959 killings portrayed in Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood."
