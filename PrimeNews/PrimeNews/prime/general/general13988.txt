NEW YORK (AP) â€” Cameras remained off Monday at the White House press briefing on orders of the Trump administration, sidelining one of daytime television's most popular features on the same day that ABC announced new digital programming tied to it.  Following rules set by the White House, news networks only began airing press secretary Sean Spicer's question-and-answer session after it was done.  Without its own affiliated cable network, ABC is looking for different ways to take advantage of its expertise, said Rick Klein, the network's political director.  Trump has given only one free-wheeling news conference since taking office nearly six months ago, and has lately restricted most of his interviews to friendly outfits like Fox News Channel.
