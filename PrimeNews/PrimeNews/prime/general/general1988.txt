NEW YORK (AP) â€” It took two years, but Dr. Henry Bello made good on his threats. After he was forced to resign as a family medicine doctor amid sexual harassment allegations, he told colleagues he would be back to kill them. On Friday, Bello returned to Bronx Lebanon Hospital with an AM-15 assault rifle tucked under his white lab coat and opened fire in his old department, killing one doctor and critically wounding six other people at the hospital, according to law enforcement officials.
