Spain's Garbine Muguruza has beaten American Venus Williams 7-5 6-0 to win the Wimbledon women's singles title. When the 23-year-old's challenge revealed Williams' last forehand to have landed long, she crouched down in disbelief with her face planted in her hands. Muguruza earns Â£2.2million for this win at the All England Club and also makes up for finishing runner-up to Venus' sister Serena in the final of two years ago.
