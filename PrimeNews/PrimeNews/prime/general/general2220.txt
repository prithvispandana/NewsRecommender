VATICAN CITY (AP) â€” Pope Francis on Saturday pushed out the Vatican's conservative doctrine chief, tapping a deputy instead to lead the powerful congregation that handles sex abuse cases and guarantees Catholic orthodoxy around the world. Francis and German Cardinal Gerhard Mueller had clashed, most recently over the pope's cautious opening to letting civilly remarried Catholics to receive Communion. Mueller had insisted they cannot, given church teaching on the indissolubility of marriage.
