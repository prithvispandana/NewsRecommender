SHENYANG, China (AP) â€” Family members of Liu Xiaobo scattered the Nobel Peace Prize laureate's ashes into the sea on Saturday in funeral proceedings closely orchestrated by the Chinese government following his death from cancer while in custody. Liu's supporters said the move was intended by the authoritarian government to permanently erase any traces of China's best-known political prisoner, who died Thursday at the age of 61. The sea burial took place Saturday at noon, just hours after his cremation, a spokesman for the northeastern city of Shenyang, where Liu died, told reporters.
