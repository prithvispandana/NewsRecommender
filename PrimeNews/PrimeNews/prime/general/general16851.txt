On the eve of the busiest departure day for record numbers of British holidaymakers, The Independent can reveal that unprecedented travel deals are available due to a ferocious fares war during the peak month of August.  From Leeds/Bradford to Ibiza, return fares of £40 are available on Ryanair for a wide range of dates in August, such as 1-4 August or 8-17 August. For a round-trip journey of over 2,000 miles, such a fare would normally only be available at times of lowest demand — not the summer peak.
