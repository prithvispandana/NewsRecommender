On a gravel road in Louisiana's Cajun country, a sheriff's deputy stopped a man and his girlfriend riding an ATV as the couple headed out to go frogging -- the popular pastime of hunting for frogs in ditches and ponds. A struggle broke out between the men, and the deputy shot DeJuan Guillory dead. Only two people know what happened that predawn morning of July 6: the deputy who fired the fatal shots and Guillory's girlfriend -- DeQuince Brown -- who's now charged with attempted first-degree murder of a police officer.
