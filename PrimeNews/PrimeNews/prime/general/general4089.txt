Thousands of passengers at Britain’s busiest airport faced delays and disruption after a fire alarm was triggered at Terminal 3.  Travellers waiting to board flights were evacuated onto the apron, while those who had been in the check-in area were ordered to leave the building.  The emergency evacuation began at around 12.30pm. Passengers who had already passed through security were told to follow staff out of the gate area and on to the apron.
