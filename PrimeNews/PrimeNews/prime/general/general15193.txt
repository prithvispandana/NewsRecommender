Nagaland chief minister Shurhozelie Liezietsu hinted at stepping down before taking the floor test on Wednesday at 9.30 am following a fresh notice from governor PB Acharya. The governor's directive came soon after the Kohima bench of Gauhati High Court cleared the decks for the trust vote to resolve the ongoing crisis over leadership within the ruling Naga People's Front.
