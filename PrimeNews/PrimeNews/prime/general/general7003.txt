TOKYO (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is on the cusp of having something his father and grandfather could only dream of — the ability to unleash a nuclear attack on the United States. For anyone paying attention, the test launch of his country's first intercontinental ballistic missile on the Fourth of July came as little surprise. Kim has been racing to develop better and longer-range missiles and vowed in his New Year's address this would be the year of the ICBM. He made good on that vow with the launch of the "Hwasong-14." But that isn't all he's been doing.
