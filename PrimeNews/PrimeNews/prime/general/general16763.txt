MINNEAPOLIS (AP) â€” Police and protesters heralded the arrival of the body camera as a critical window into officers' everyday activities after the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri. But as the killing of an Australian woman by a Minneapolis officer over the weekend showed, the technology depends on officers turning on their devices. And often they don't do so. Officer Mohamed Noor fatally shot 40-year-old Justine Damond on Saturday night while responding to an emergency call Damond placed to report a possible sexual assault near her house. Like the rest of the city's officers, both Noor and his partner had body cameras but didn't turn them on until after the shooting. It's not clear why the officers hadn't switched on their cameras.
