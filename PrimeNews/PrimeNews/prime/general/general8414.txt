WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Donald Trump's outside counsel lambasted a random emailer after the man suggested he step down following reports that explored why he had not sought a security clearance. In a series of emails obtained by ProPublica, attorney Marc Kasowitz used profanity and threatened the man. One of his four messages says: "I already know where you live. I'm on you." A spokesman for Kasowitz confirmed the authenticity of the emails and says Kasowitz "intends to apologize" to the man. Spokesman Mike Sitrick added that the missives were sent at the end of a "very long day."
