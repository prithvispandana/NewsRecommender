WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Donald Trump's push this week to get Americans to buy goods "made in America" is harder than it might seem. Even for Trump. The gold-plated pens the president uses to sign laws are assembled in Rhode Island but lacquered and engraved in China. The Boeing jet he posed with to showcase America's industrial might is 30 percent foreign-made. The firetruck the administration parked at the White House this week to promote U.S.-made goods gets about 10 percent of its parts from abroad.
