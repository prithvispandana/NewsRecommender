KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) â€” J.D. Martinez had been the subject of trade speculation for weeks, and it reached such a crescendo Monday night that even his mom texted to ask if Detroit's star outfielder had been dealt when he left a game in Kansas City with a sore back. Turns out she was only off by a day. The Arizona Diamondbacks acquired Martinez for a trio of prospects on Tuesday, hoping to solidify a trouble spot in the outfield with a sorely needed right-handed bat for a run at the playoffs.
