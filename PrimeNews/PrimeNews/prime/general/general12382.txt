Less than a fifth of children get the recommended level of exercise by the time they leave primary school, data suggests. Between the age brackets of five-to-seven and 11-to-12, there is a 39 per cent drop in the proportion being moderately active for at least 60 minutes every day. Some 28 per cent are hitting the target when aged five toÂ seven, but this drops to 17 per cent between the ages of 11 and 12 for children across England.
