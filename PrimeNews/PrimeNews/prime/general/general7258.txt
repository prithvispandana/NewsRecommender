LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” With "Game of Thrones" off the Emmy battlefield this time around, the likely beneficiaries will be streaming dramas and, in a reversal of fortune, a broadcast series. Netflix's "The Crown" and "Stranger Things" and Hulu's "The Handmaid's Tale," all streamed shows, could be among the nominees to be announced Thursday at the TV academy by Anna Chlumsky ("Veep") and Shemar Moore ("Criminal Minds," the upcoming "S.W.A.T.") The announcement will be streamed live at 11:30 a.m. EDT on www.emmys.com .
