Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley reportedly once vomited in a pub fireplace at a company meeting after drinking 12 pints of lager with vodka chasers, a court has heard. Finance expert Jeffrey Blue is suing Mr Ashley, who he claims reneged on a £15m deal the pair allegedly made at another boozy meeting in the Horse and Groom pub in Fitzrovia, London, during 2013.
