NEW HOPE, Pa. (AP) — Investigators say they've found the body of one of four missing young men along with other human remains buried on a Pennsylvania farm. Bucks County District Attorney Matthew Weintraub said at a news conference early Thursday morning that cadaver dogs led them to the spot on the farm in Solebury Township where they found human remains inside a 12 ½-foot-deep (3.66-meter-deep) common grave. The body identified was that of 19-year-old Dean Finocchiaro. The other remains have not yet been ID'd.
