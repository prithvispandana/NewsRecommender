An Iraqi soldier dubbed "the Lion of Mosul" reportedly killed six Isis fighters after sneaking behind their lines and pretending to be on their side.  Mohammed Qasim is said to have donned a smock and scarf, before sneaking past the Islamist group's heavily guarded defences in the northern Iraqi city.  He was able to kill the militant fighters after fooling them into thinking he was on their side.
