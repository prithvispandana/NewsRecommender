MINNEAPOLIS (AP) â€” The New York Yankees made an early push for playoff run Tuesday night, acquiring infielder Todd Frazier and relievers David Robertson and Tommy Kahnle from the Chicago White Sox for reliever Tyler Clippard and three prospects. The Yankees currently hold the second AL wild-card spot. They're close to the AL East-leading Boston Red Sox. "It should tell them, 'Hey, we're in this,' and we need to continue to play and play hard and play better than we've done," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said after a 6-3 victory in Minnesota. "But it should be a pick-me-up in there in a sense, like, 'Hey, there's a lot of people who believe in this club.'"
