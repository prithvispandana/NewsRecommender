PARIS (AP) â€” With a gilded tour of one of France's most storied monuments and a military parade bristling with weapons, French President Emmanuel Macron is positioning himself as the indispensable intermediary between Europe and Donald Trump. Macron made a point of detailing both the long history of ties between France and America and the areas where he and Trump disagree as he hosted the U.S. president for a Bastille Day visit. But he made clear it was in the spirit of bluntness with a friend and ally, even offering a conspiratorial wink during a press conference featuring the two men.
