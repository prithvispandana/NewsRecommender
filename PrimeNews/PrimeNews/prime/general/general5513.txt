Striking back at dissidents in lightning speed, Nagaland chief minister Shurhozelie Liezietsu on Sunday dropped four cabinet ministers, who have also been suspended from the Naga Peoples Front along with 6 others, including former CM TR Zeliang. Liezietsu recanted soon after Zeliang wrote to governor staking claim to form the govt with support of 41 MLAs.
