Philip Hammond has all-but admitted saying public sector workers were "overpaid".Â  The Chancellor said it was "a simple fact" that wages for employees of the UK's public services earned about 10 per cent more than private sector staff when "very generous" pensions contributions were taken into account. Mr Hammond was grilled by the BBC's Andrew Marr over comments he reportedly made during a Cabinet meeting this week.
