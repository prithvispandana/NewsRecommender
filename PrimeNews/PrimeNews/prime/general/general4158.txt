A prison officer has reportedly told an inquest how a colleague suggested they delay calling an ambulance after discovering Sarah Reed dead in her cell at Holloway Prison. Reed, who was black, died in January 2016 after what her mother described as a “collective failure” of authorities. She had suffered a long history of mental health problems after her baby daughter, who had muscular atrophy, died suddenly in 2003.
