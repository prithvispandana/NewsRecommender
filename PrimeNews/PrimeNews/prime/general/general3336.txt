NEW YORK (AP) â€” Maria Menounos says she has been diagnosed with a benign brain tumor and has announced her resignation from E! News. Menounos tells People magazine that she underwent surgery last month to remove a golf-ball-sized tumor discovered in February. Menounos says 99.9 percent of the tumor was removed during the seven-hour procedure on June 8. She says there's a small chance that it could come back.
