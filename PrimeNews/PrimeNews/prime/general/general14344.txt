DALLAS (AP) â€” Cowboys wide receiver Lucky Whitehead is asking for help locating his pitbull Blitz after burglars took the dog and demanded a $10,000 ransom. Whitehead told NBC 5 in Dallas ( http://bit.ly/2ta2Qpv ) that he was in Florida last week when Blitz was taken from his Texas home, along with some shoes and bags. Whitehead has since gotten phone calls demanding he "cut a check" if he wants to get Blitz back alive, but he refused to pay $10,000 without first getting proof that Blitz is OK.
