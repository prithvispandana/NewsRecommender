The number of tower blocks which have failed emergency fire tests has nearly doubled to 60 in 25 different council areas - up from 34 in 17 areas.Â  Councils across the country have launched emergency reviews of their towers following the fire at Grenfell Tower in London which is believed to have killed at least 79 people. The fire is believed to have spread due to flammable cladding on the outside of the building which was designed to provide insulation and improve the look of the 24 storey tower.
