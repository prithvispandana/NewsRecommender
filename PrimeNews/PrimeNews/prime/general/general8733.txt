Two men on a moped carried out five acids attacks during a spree across London which lasted less than 90 minutes, police said. The Metropolitan Police said one victim had been left with "life-changing" injuries after being doused on Thursday night in the east of the capital. The assaults appeared to be linked and two involved victims having their mopeds stolen, they added.
