NEW YORK (AP) — The stranglehold that autumn prestige films have on Oscar season just might be wilting in the summer sun. Christopher Nolan's World War II epic "Dunkirk" hits theaters Friday, but the overflowing reviews have already made it abundantly clear: It's a major Oscar contender and a best-picture front-runner — even in July. And "Dunkirk," which analysts expect to debut this weekend with $60 million-plus in domestic ticket sales, might not be the only box-office hit to crash this year's awards season. The zeitgeist-grabbing sensations "Get Out" and "Wonder Woman" could also be players come Academy Awards time.
