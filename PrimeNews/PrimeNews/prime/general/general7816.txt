A far-right organisation has launched a boat in the Mediterranean to confront ships rescuing refugees and send them "back to Africa". Defend Europe, a group linked to the European anti-Islam and anti-immigrant “Identitarian” movement, is currently sailing a 25-crew 422 tonne vessel to the Libyan coast in a bid to block search-and-rescue vessels operated by humanitarian organisations.
