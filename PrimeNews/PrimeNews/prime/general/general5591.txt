SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” Yul Dorn and his wife raised their son and daughter in a three-bedroom home crammed with family photos, one they bought in a historically African-American neighborhood in San Francisco more than two decades ago. Today, the couple is living in a motel after they were evicted last year, having lost a foreclosure battle. A second home they inherited is also in default. The Dorns expect to join the growing ranks of African-Americans who do not own their homes, a rate that was nearly 30 percentage points higher than that of whites in 2016, according to a new report.
