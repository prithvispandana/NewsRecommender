NEW YORK (AP) — Thousands of commuters heading into New York on Monday faced adjustments — some annoying, some time consuming — on the first day of two months of repairs at the country's busiest train station, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo had predicted will make for a "summer of hell." But no apparent major problems were reported during the morning rush. As the crowd of rail commuters heading into Penn Station grew so did the confusion. Some seemed bewildered by a new routine devised to accommodate the extensive repairs to tracks and signals at the station.
