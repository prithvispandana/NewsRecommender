If reports are to be believed then director Rajkumar Hirani is all set to make a cameo in his forthcoming film. The report suggests that the ace director will be seen doing a cameo in the yet untitled Sanjay Dutt biopic. Raju will be essaying the role of Subhash Ghai in the film whose films Dutt has been a part of and will further approach Ranbir, who plays Dutt, to make a biopic on him. If the cameo does happen, it will be interesting to see the director on the other side of the lens after a long time.
