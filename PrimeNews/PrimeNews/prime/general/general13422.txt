Brexit secretary David Davis has been criticised after being pictured sitting down to EU negotiations in Brussels without any notes. The minister returned to the UK after half a day of talks and a photo opportunity after Article 50 discussions resumed on Monday morning. In a photograph posted out through official channels, Mr Davisâ€™s approach was in stark contrast to the European Commission negotiators, who sat with large piles of paper in organised binders.
