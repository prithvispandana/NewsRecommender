The Court of Appeal  in Northern Ireland has refused to rule on allowing rape victims to have abortions, ruling that it is not up the courts to decide on abortion law. Northern Ireland's Appeal Court said abortion reform should be left to Stormont's Assembly as it ruled that the law was compatible with existing provision.  The court was set to decide on Thursday whether to uphold two high court rulings from 2015 and 2016 that ruled existing abortion laws breached a woman’s right to a private life under European law.
