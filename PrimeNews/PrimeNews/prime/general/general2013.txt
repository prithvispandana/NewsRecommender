At least one former resident of Grenfell Tower is still having rent taken out of their bank account for the burnt-out property in north Kensington, according to a campaign director representing survivors. Yvette Williams, coordinator of Justice4Grenfell, said a resident had recently obtained a new bank card and other documents following the blaze, only to find that rent instalments had been deducted.
