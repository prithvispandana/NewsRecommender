Salman Khan's recent film 'Tubelight', directed by Kabir Khan that created a huge buzz before the release of the film, failed to rake the expected moolah at the Indian box office. In spite of having an Eid release, it didn't help the makers garner a great response as 'Tubelight' failed to impress the fans and critics alike.  If that wasn't enough, reports suggest that, when a few of Bhai's fans went to the theatres in Brussels, Belgium, to catch a glimpse of their favourite actor, they were shocked to see that the film was marketed as Shah Rukh Khan's film. SRK only has a cameo in 'Tubelight' and it's well known that the protagonist of the film is Salman and not Shah Rukh.  Naturally, a few fans were left disillusioned when they saw silver screen corridors alluding to the film as Shah Rukh Khan's. Perhaps, this was a move to salvage the collections of the film in the country.
