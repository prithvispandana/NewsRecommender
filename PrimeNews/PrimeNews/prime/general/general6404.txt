Theresa May has suspended the Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris after she used the racist slur "n***** in the woodpile". The whip has been removed from the MP for Newton Abbot, in Devon, after she was recorded casually using the term at a panel event to discuss Brexit. “I was shocked to hear of these remarks, which are completely unacceptable,” the Prime Minister said.
