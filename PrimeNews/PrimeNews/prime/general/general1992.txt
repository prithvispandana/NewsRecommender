STRASBOURG, France (AP) â€” Current and past world leaders gathered Saturday to bid farewell to the late Helmut Kohl, recalling the former German chancellor as a man who was instrumental in uniting Europe and bringing about reconciliation between former adversaries on the continent. Kohl, who died June 16 at the age of 87, was the first person to be honored with an official memorial event by the European Union in the French city of Strasbourg. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the ceremony at the European Parliament's seat, close to the border with Germany, was Kohl's own choice, describing him as "a German patriot and at the same time a European patriot."
