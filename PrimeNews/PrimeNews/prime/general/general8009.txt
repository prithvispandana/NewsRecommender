Virginia Wade’s 40-year-old record as the last British woman to win the Wimbledon singles title will stay intact for at least another 12 months as Johanna Konta’s remarkable run finally came to an end here on Thursday. At 26 years of age Konta should have plenty more chances to emulate Wade’s 1977 victory, but even if she never reaches the semi-finals here again she will at least have the consolation of knowing that she was denied a place in the final by one of the game’s all-time greats.
