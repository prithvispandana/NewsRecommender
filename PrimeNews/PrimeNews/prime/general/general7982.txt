WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Education Department's civil rights chief apologized anew Thursday, this time to victims of campus sexual assault, for her "flippant" remarks attributing 90 percent of such claims to both parties being drunk, one participant in the meeting said. The apology by Candice Jackson, acting assistant secretary for civil rights, came amid a series of meetings that her boss, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, is holding to examine the impact of President Barack Obama's crackdown on campus sexual violence.
