HONOLULU (AP) â€” Karen Hastings was in her 31st floor Honolulu apartment when she smelled smoke. She ran out to her balcony, looked down, and saw flames five floors below her. "The fire just blew up and went flying right out the windows," the 71-year-old Hastings said of the first moments of the high-rise blaze that killed at least three people and injured 12. "And that was like a horror movie. Except it wasn't a horror movie, it was for real." The fire broke out Friday afternoon in a unit on the 26th floor, where all three of the dead were found, Fire Chief Manuel Neves said.
