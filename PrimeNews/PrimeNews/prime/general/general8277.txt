WASHINGTON (AP) — If congressional Republicans succeed in repealing and replacing "Obamacare," expect a big Rose Garden celebration with President Donald Trump taking credit. If they fail? Trump has already indicated he will hold Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell responsible, setting up an intraparty blame game that could be devastating for the GOP. Trump made it clear this week the onus for delivering a major Republican achievement and fulfilling seven years of GOP promises is on the six-term Kentucky senator, who is battle-hardened by legislative negotiating — not on the president and author of "The Art of the Deal."
