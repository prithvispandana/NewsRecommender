Chris Martin was so in awe of a fan gliding toward him over the crowd in a wheelchair that he invited the man on stage to help the band sing a song. 29-year-old Rob was passed aloft and along by audience members at the Croke Park, Dublin gig, being spotted by Martin as he neared the stage. The frontman introduced him to the crowd, with Rob whipping out a harmonica and playing a traditional song with help from Coldplay.
