The government has revoked the passport of fugitive Islamic preacher Zakir Naik following a recommendation from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) which has already booked him under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for his terror links. The revocation of the passport by the regional passport office in Mumbai makes Zakir Naik a stateless person.
