US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said "global action" is required to stop the "global threat" posed by North Korea as tensions rose following the rogue state's successful test of its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Ratcheting up the pressure on Pyongyang, Mr Tillerson said the US would "enact stronger measures" against the North, adding Washington would never accept it as a nuclear power.
