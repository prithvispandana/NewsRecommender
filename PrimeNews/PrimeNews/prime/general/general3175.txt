Donald Trump has offered to help Charlie Gard, a critically ill 10-month-old who is being treated in London. The news comes after a UK court ruled the infant's life support machine should be turned off. In an unusual move, the US President tweeted, "If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the UK and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so."
