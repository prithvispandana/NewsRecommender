Labour has vowed to try to wreck the Brexit process by voting against the flagship “Repeal Bill”, unless Theresa May makes dramatic changes. Keir Starmer, the party’s Brexit spokesman, said Labour would attempt to defeat the legislation in just three months’ time – significantly tightening the screw on the Prime Minister. He attacked the Government for refusing to listen to calls – from MPs of all parties – to re-write its Brexit plans since they were first published in March.
