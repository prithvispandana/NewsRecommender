BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) — President Donald Trump has tweeted a mock video that shows him pummeling a man in a business suit — his face obscured by the CNN logo — outside a wrestling ring. It's not clear who produced the brief video, but it was posted from Trump's official Twitter account. Trump's been stepping up verbal attacks on the media — and cable networks particularly. But an adviser thinks "no one would perceive that as a threat. I hope they don't."
