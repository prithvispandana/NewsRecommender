Dutt was earlier sentenced to five years in jail for possession of arms, which were a part of the consignment used in the 1993 blasts. The actor was on bail during the trial, and surrendered in May 2013 after the SC upheld his conviction. Dutt was let out in February 2016, eight months early, on account of his good conduct.
