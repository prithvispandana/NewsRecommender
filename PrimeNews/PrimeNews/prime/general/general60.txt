Former EDL leader Tommy Robinson has been filmed brawling with a man at Ascot. The right-wing campaigner, dressed in a smart black suit and tie, is seen throwing a right hand punch at the man as he stumbles backwards holding his hands up at the start of the 15 second clip. Mr Robinson, 34, pauses briefly when the man falls to the ground before grabbing his suit jacket with his left hand and throwing another six punches with his right.
