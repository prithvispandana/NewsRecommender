SEOUL, South Korea (AP) â€” If North Korea's claim Tuesday of its first ICBM test-launch is true, it has barreled over a red line that the world has long called a tripwire for potential nuclear disaster. As always with North Korea, however, it's hard to tell how wide the gulf is between reality and rhetoric. Analysts, for instance, believe the latest missile may be able to hit Alaska, a marked improvement on past efforts and potentially placing it in the intercontinental ballistic missile category, but far from backing North Korea's claim it can now "strike anywhere on Earth."
