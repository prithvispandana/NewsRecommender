WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The nation's capital is bracing for a long, hot summer, and that's not even counting the weather. The White House is immersed in allegations of scandal. Congressional Republicans are ensnared in their own divisions. Instead of movement on health care, taxes and more, GOP control figures to produce a grim summer slog as lawmakers and the Trump administration grind it out into August and beyond. That's traditionally summer vacation time in Washington, D.C., when Congress goes on a five-week recess, and much of the rest of the town follows suit to escape the stultifying heat and humidity. President Barack Obama would embark on an extended annual visit to Martha's Vineyard.
