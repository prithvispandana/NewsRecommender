WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Donald Trump on Friday will discuss North Korea and trade with South Korea's new leader, whose pro-engagement stance toward the North could clash with the U.S. administration's intent to crank up sanctions. Trump welcomed South Korean President Moon Jae-in for formal talks at the White House. The two leaders had their first meeting over dinner Thursday, shortly after the Treasury Department blacklisted a Chinese bank accused of conducting millions in illicit business with North Korea.
