INDIANAPOLIS (AP) â€” State election officials voiced doubt Saturday over whether adequate security measures can be adopted before 2018 elections to safeguard against the possibility of foreign government interfering in U.S. elections. That's according to attendees at a weekend gathering of the National Association of Secretaries of State, whose conference was held amid an uproar over a White House commission investigating President Donald Trump's allegations of voter fraud and heightened concern about Russian attempts to interfere in U.S. elections.
