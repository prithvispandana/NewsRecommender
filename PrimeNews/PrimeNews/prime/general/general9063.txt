Theresa May has hinted at the introduction of new legislation to combat a spate of acid attacks after last night's “horrific” rampage in London. It comes after two men on mopeds carried out five acid attacks during a spree across the capital which lasted less than 90 minutes, according to the Metropolitan Police.  Asked about the assaults and whether a change in sentencing guidelines was needed, the Prime Minister’s spokeswoman said Ms May viewed the acid attack as “horrific”.
