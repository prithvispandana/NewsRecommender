Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken a swipe at Britain over Brexit and argued the country is becoming increasingly inward-looking. During a press conference in Dublin with Ireland’s newly elected Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, Mr Trudeau took aim at Britain and the US. The leader of the Liberal Party argued Canada and Ireland should take advantage of their respective neighbour's increasingly isolated approach by seizing new openings on the global stage.
