Police Minister Nick Hurd has told the House of Commons that ending the public sector pay freeze is "under active discussion." Shadow policing minister Louise Haigh, a former Special Constable, said she had witnessed a "collapse in morale as the Government ignored warnings over jobs, pay and resources". She asked: "So does the minister agree with the Home Secretary or the Foreign Secretary over whether our bravest and best should continue to experience a real terms pay cut until 2020?"
