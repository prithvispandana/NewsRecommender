Emmanuel Macron called anti-Zionism a new form of anti-Semitism during a strongly-worded speech in which he condemned France’s historic collaboration with the Nazis. The French President was speaking in Paris at an event to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Vel D’Hiv round-up, in which 13,152 French Jews were deported to Nazi concentration camps by the then French government in July 1942. Fewer than 100 of those detained survived.
