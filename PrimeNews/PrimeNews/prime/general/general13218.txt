A man from India's lower-caste Dalit (Untouchable) community is expected to be elected president. Ram Nath Kovind, 71, is the former governor of the eastern state of Bihar. The Dalits are the lowest rank of India's traditional caste system, and were traditionally considered "impure" and pushed to the margins of Indian society.
