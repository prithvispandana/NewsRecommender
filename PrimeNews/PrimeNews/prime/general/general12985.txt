Theresa May is to reprimand her Cabinet ministers for leaking and briefing against one another, Downing Street has said. The Prime Minister's spokesperson said the PM would use a meeting on Tuesday to remind her deputies that they should be "having all discussions of government policy in private". The intervention comes amid increasing signs of infighting amongst top Tories â€“ with Chancellor Philip Hammond the target of several negative briefings in recent days.
