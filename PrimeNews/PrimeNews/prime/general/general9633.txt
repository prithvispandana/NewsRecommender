Premier League footballer Jermain Defoe wore an England shirt for the funeral of his six-year-old "best friend", Bradley Lowery, whose cancer battle captured hearts around the world. Thousands of people lined the streets of Blackhall, County Durham, ahead of the service at St Joseph's Catholic Church, where the youngster was baptised six years ago. A piper lead the horse-drawn carriage carrying his coffin through the village, which came to a halt to pay tribute to the little boy with the beaming smile.
