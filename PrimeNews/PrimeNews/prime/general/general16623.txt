A Yosemite National Park official says Highway 140 into Yosemite Valley from Mariposa is closed as a stubborn wildfire rages several dozen miles from the park.  A stubborn wildfire burning in the rugged mountains outside Yosemite National Park has placed nearly 1,500 structures under threat Wednesday.  The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection says that the fire nearly doubled in size overnight and has now scorched roughly 71 square miles (183 square kilometers).  Roughly 5,000 people are under evacuation orders as the fire burns in steep terrain with dense vegetation.  The blaze burning since Sunday was making its way to the hills on the edge of Mariposa, a town of about 2,000 people under a mandatory evacuation order.
