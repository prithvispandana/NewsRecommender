JERUSALEM (AP) â€” The Latest on an attack by Palestinian gunmen near Jerusalem holy site (all times local): 12:10 p.m. Israel's police chief says two officers were killed in an attack by Palestinian assailants near a major Jerusalem shrine. Roni Alsheich says the policemen died of wounds sustained in the attack earlier Friday. He spoke after three Arab citizens of Israel opened fire on police near one of the holiest sites in Jerusalem. The compound is the holiest site in Judaism and the third-holiest in Islam. The site has been a flashpoint for violence in the past, with friction there sparking major rounds of Israeli-Palestinian violence.
