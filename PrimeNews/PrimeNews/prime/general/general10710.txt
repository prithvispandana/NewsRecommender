PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The cousins started small — break-ins, jewelry heists and traffic violations — but on Friday they were charged in a grisly crime spree that ended with police unearthing the bodies of four young men from two pits buried deep on a sprawling family-owned farm. Police may have found the missing men after a grueling, five-day search in sweltering heat and pelting rain, but it's still not clear why the 20-year-old suspects' crimes escalated from petty offenses to a string of alleged murders that transfixed the region through their sheer senselessness.
