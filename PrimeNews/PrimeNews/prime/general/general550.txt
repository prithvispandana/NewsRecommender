Nicola Sturgeon has pulled back from an early second referendum to secure Scottish independence, after the SNP’s election setback The Scottish First Minister announced she would “reset the plan we set out on 13 March” – which promised legislation at Holyrood to try to force the referendum. The move backfired in this month’s general election, when her Scottish National Party lost 21 of its 56 seats, falling to 35 per cent of the vote.
