Nigel Farage has said he will not stand to replace Paul Nuttall as Ukip leader. The three-time party leader acknowledged his habit of resigning and returning to the role had become an “ongoing joke”, adding: “To return now would be premature.” He said the threat of violence and the “amateur shambles” of the party's ruling national executive committee were the main factors in his decision not to stand.
