Theresa May has accused Jeremy Corbyn of failing to condemn threats against Conservative election candidates – just minutes after asking for his help to stamp it out. The Prime Minister said she was “surprised” that the Labour leader had not spoken out in the days since the shocking intimidation on the campaign trail was revealed. The accusation is certain to infuriate Mr Corbyn, who has repeatedly condemned abusive behaviour by Labour activists in the past.
