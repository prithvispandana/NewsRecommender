A 16-year-old girl took her own life by hanging after she was bullied at school, an inquest was told. Dagmara Przybysz, who was born in Poland and went to school at Pool Academy near Redruth, was found dead in a toilet in May 2016. The inquest heard that a pastoral support manager at the school, Susan Kent, said she saw the teenager several times before she died, but she had "never mentioned any problems of racism".
