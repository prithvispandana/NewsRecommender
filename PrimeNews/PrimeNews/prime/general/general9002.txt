Conor McGregor has drawn yet more criticism by claiming he can't be racist because he is “half-black from the belly button down.” The comment has landed the MMA star in further controversy, after he was criticised earlier in the week for making racially charged comments at press conferences in Los Angeles and Toronto. McGregor is currently on a four-stop press tour with the American boxer Floyd Mayweather, to promote their light-middleweight fight on August 26.
