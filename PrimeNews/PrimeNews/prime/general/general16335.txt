US banking giant Morgan Stanley has chosen Frankfurt as the site of its post-Brexit EU hub in a move that could see 200 jobs leave the UK, the Press Association understands. The bank will be applying for a licence with the local German regulator that will allow it to continue trading across the EU after Britain completes its divorce with the bloc. Around 200 UK jobs could be relocated as a result of the decision, impacting staff in both front and back office operations.
