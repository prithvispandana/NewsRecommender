The UK is trailing behind other European countries when it comes to diagnosing and treating cancer, a new report says. The study, commissioned by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) - which represents drugs firms, also points to worse survival rates in the UK. Compared to the average for Europe, the UK lags behind on nine out of 10 cancers when it comes to survival - including bowel, lung, breast, ovarian, prostate and kidney cancer.
