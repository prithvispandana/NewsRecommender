Jeremy Corbyn was filmed in an awkward encounter when a woman tried to interrupt his speech. As the Labour leader addressed a large crowd at the Durham Miners’ Gala, the woman stepped up to the podium and tried to grab his arm. Mr Corbyn had just invited Theresa May to step down and call an election when she began shouting and resisted attempts from staff to get off the stage.
