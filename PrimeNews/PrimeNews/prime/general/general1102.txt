Theresa May has strongly criticised Kensington and Chelsea Council for shutting down its meeting into the Grenfell Tower fire, after it was ordered to admit journalists. “We would have expected them to have respected the court ruling about the meeting being open,” the Prime Minister’s spokeswoman said. The criticism follows angry scenes on Thursday, when the beleaguered Tory leader of the council, Nick Paget-Brown, closed the meeting after a brief statement.
