ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) â€” Disney Parks isn't letting Han Solo or Luke Skywalker save the day at their new Star Wars-themed lands. "When you step in to the world, you're the hero," Chris Beatty, Disney Imagineer and executive director of the new expansions said. Beatty was just one of many Disney representatives who spoke Saturday on the new Star Wars-themed lands at the Disney fan expo D23 in Anaheim, California. Bob Chapek, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Chairman, led a joyous panel where he unveiled many new projects for both domestic and international parks. New "Ratatouille," ''Guardians of the Galaxy" and "Tron" attractions are headed to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida.
