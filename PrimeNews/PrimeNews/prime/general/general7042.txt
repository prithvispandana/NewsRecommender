SHENYANG, China (AP) â€” The Latest on the medical condition of China's imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Liu Xiaobo (all times local): 7 a.m. Thursday U.S. officials want Chinese authorities to allow Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo and his family the freedom to choose his medical care. The hospital in Shenyang, China, that has been treating Liu for advanced liver cancer said Wednesday he was in life-threatening condition from multiple organ failure. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said from Washington: "We remain concerned that both Mr. Liu and his family are unable to communicate with the outside world and that he is not free to seek the medical treatment of his choosing." Sanders urged China to grant him full parole and release his wife from house arrest. Liu was convicted in 2009 of inciting subversion for calling for political reform and was awarded the Nobel a year later while serving his sentence.
