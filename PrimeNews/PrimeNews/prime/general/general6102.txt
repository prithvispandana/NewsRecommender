The parents of sick baby Charlie Gard will have the chance to present fresh evidence that their son should receive experimental treatment, a High Court judge has ruled. Mr Justice Francis asked Charlie's parents Connie Yates and Chris Gard to set out any new evidence they had on Wednesday prior to a full-day hearing on Thursday. The decision came after an emotionally charged court session in which Ms Yates wept in frustration and Mr Gard yelled at a lawyer.
