North Korea claims to have successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can strike targets anywhere in the world, following its most recent launch. The missile, which the US and South Korea had said was an intermediate-range projectile, landed inside Japan's exclusive economic zone on Tuesday. The South's president, Moon Jae-in, said his country's military was analysing the launch and the possibility the missile was an ICBM.
