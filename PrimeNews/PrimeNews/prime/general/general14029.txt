LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” The state Medical Board can dig through prescription drug records without a search warrant or subpoena, the California Supreme Court ruled Monday. The board did not violate the privacy of patients when it searched a statewide database while investigating a Burbank doctor who was placed on probation for complaints that included excessive prescriptions, the court ruled unanimously. The ruling, at a time of a nationwide epidemic of opioid abuse, pitted the rights of patients against the government's ability to easily investigate whether doctors are overprescribing powerful drugs.
