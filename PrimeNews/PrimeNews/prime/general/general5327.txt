Greek authorities said a group of about 10 men killed an American tourist during a bar fight early Friday morning on a Greek island, state news agency ANA-MPA reported. 
 Bakari Henderson, a 22-year-old recent graduate of the University of Arizona, was in a bar with friends in Laganas, a tourist village on the island of Zakynthos, when another customer approached him. The confrontation quickly escalated to a fistfight, and the bar's security guard asked the two to leave, according to the state news agency. 
 The fight continued outside, where more people, including two bar employees, began punching Henderson.
