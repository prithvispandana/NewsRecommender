A trade deal between the UK and the US would not be enough to offset the damage caused by Brexit, a cabinet minister had admitted. David Lidington, the Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor, said even a “big new trade deal” with the US would not replace the benefits of being in the EU single market and that deals with other countries would be needed too. “It wouldn’t be enough on its own, no”, he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “But it would be a very good thing to have, as would trade deals with the emerging  economies of Asia and Latin America.”
