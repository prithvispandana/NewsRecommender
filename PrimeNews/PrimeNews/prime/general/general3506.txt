BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) â€” President Donald Trump offered to help a terminally ill British baby on Monday, saying on Twitter that "if we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so." Charlie Gard suffers from a rare genetic condition and is unable to breathe unaided. Last week, his parents lost a legal battle to take him to the U.S. for trial therapy. His parents and a London children's hospital said Friday that the 10-month-old boy will be given "more time" before life support is withdrawn.
