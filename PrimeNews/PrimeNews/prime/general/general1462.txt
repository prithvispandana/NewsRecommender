England could follow Scotland and Wales by moving to an “opt out” system of organ donation, Downing Street has indicated. Theresa May’s spokesperson said that the Government was “keeping a close eye” on the new policy enacted by the devolved governments to see whether it boosted donation rates. “Organ donation hit a record high last year here and we obviously want that to continue and continue to rise,” she said.
