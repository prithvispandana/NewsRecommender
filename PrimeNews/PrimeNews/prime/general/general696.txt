PARIS (AP) â€” The cyberattack that has locked up computers around the world while demanding a ransom may not be an extortion attempt after all, but an effort to create havoc in Ukraine, security experts say. "There may be a more nefarious motive behind the attack," Gavin O'Gorman, an investigator with U.S. antivirus firm Symantec, said in a blog post . "Perhaps this attack was never intended to make money, rather to simply disrupt a large number of Ukrainian organizations."
