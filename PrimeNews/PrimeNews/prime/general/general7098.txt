LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Shia LaBeouf apologized Wednesday for a racist tirade against Georgia police officers and jailors who arrested him Saturday for public drunkenness. The actor wrote in a statement posted on Twitter Wednesday that he has been publicly struggling with addiction for "far too long." He called his behavior a new low and attributed it in part to his complete disrespect for authority. The statement, which was confirmed as legitimate by LaBeouf's publicist, asked for forgiveness and said the actor was taking steps to get sober. He did not elaborate.
