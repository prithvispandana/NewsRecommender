Philip Hammond is at the centre of a fresh controversy after reportedly saying public sector workers were "overpaid". The comments were made by the Chancellor in a Cabinet meeting this week, according toÂ The Sunday Times. It is the second row in less than a week Mr Hammond has become embroiled in, after he was said to have quipped that driving trains has become so easy that "even a woman" can do it.
