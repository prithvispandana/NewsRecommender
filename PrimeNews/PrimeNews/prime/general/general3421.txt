LONDON (AP) — Write off Roger Federer at your own peril. The guy's been considered done by some folks at various times over the years, whether because of age or a bad back or a bum knee or a — gasp! — 4½-season drought without a Grand Slam title. And yet here he is, about to turn 36 next month, about to tie a record by playing in his 70th major tournament and, lo and behold, back to his old status as a popular pick to take home the title when Wimbledon begins on Monday. He is seeking an unprecedented eighth men's championship at the All England Club.
