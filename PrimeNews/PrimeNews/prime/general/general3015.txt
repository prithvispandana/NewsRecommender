Sinn Fein has blamed Theresa May’s deal with the Democratic Unionist Party for the failure to restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland, as another crisis looms. The DUP has been “emboldened” by propping up the Conservatives at Westminster, the Republican party claimed – making it less likely to compromise at Stormont. The claim came as Sinn Fein confirmed the talks were failing. “We don’t think its likely there will be a deal in the short term,” said spokesman Conor Murphy.
