The world's most streamed song has a new champion in the form of “Despacito” by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee. Universal Music Latin Entertainment has announced that, with global streams of more than 4.6 billion plays since its release six months ago, the track - featuring Justin Bieber - will beat the record today (19 July). The song knocks Bieber's very own “Sorry” into second place with combined streams of 4.38 billion on platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music.
