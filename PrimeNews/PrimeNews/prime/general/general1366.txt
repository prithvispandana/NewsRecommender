LONDON (AP) â€” Venus Williams' publicist tells The Associated Press the five-time Wimbledon champion will play at the tournament after a police report emerged in Florida saying the tennis star caused a car crash that led to the death of a passenger in another vehicle. Stephanie Jones says in an email on Friday that Williams is in London, where the year's third Grand Slam tournament is scheduled to begin Monday. Williams is seeded 10th.
