At least 149 high-rise buildings in 45 local authorities have failed fire safety tests in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire.  Cladding samples tested as part of a “major national investigation” into the use of panelling on housing blocks have so far produced a 100 per cent failure rate, a Government spokesperson said.  But concerns were being raised over the efficiency of the testing process after it emerged the checks did not extend to the insulation fitted behind the cladding.
