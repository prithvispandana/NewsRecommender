A live BBC report from Leicester city centre was cut short after a street mime artist painted entirely in silver started screaming “Go away!” and “F*** off!” in the background. The interruption occurred on the BBC East Midlands Today programme during a story about a police crackdown on “street drinkers and beggars” in the city centre following complaints of anti-social behaviour.
