Britain’s biggest budget airline has announced its post-Brexit EU base: Vienna. Although easyJet has always been UK based, it has a vast network of international and domestic flights on the Continent.  With the shape of a future UK-EU aviation agreement still uncertain, the airline is setting up a separate company, easyJet Europe, in the Austrian capital. Around 100 planes will be assigned to the subsidiary, which will allow the airline to continue to fly as at present.
