HELSINKI (AP) â€” Volvo will begin producing electric motors on all its cars from 2019, becoming the first major automaker to forgo traditional engines that rely exclusively on internal combustion. The Swedish company, which has been making cars since 1927 and in recent decades became famous for its station wagons and safety features, said Wednesday that the decision was prompted by the wishes of customers, describing it as "one of the most significant moves by any car maker." CEO Hakan Samuelsson said the shift to electric motors would "strengthen our brand image, which is a lot about protecting what is important for you (customers)."
