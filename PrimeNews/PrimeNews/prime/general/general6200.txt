BAGHDAD (AP) â€” The Latest on the fighting in Iraq's Mosul (all times local): 7:30 p.m. Iraq's prime minister has returned to Mosul and declared "total victory" in the fight against the Islamic State group there, though some fighting is expected to continue. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has congratulated Iraqi troops on their "victory" on previous occasions despite ongoing clashes. The latest announcement came in a statement posted on Twitter. Hours earlier, Associated Press reporters had seen heavy fighting still underway. It was not immediately clear if the clashes had ended. U.S.-backed Iraqi forces launched a massive operation to retake Mosul in October, and in recent days they had confined the remaining few hundred militants in an area measuring less than a square kilometer (less than a mile). Al-Abadi visited Mosul on Sunday to congratulate the troops, even as fighting still raged nearby.
