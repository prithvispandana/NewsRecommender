LONDON (AP) — Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray have ruled Wimbledon for the past 14 years, combining to win the tournament every time in that span. No real surprise, given the way that Big 4 dominates tennis. "Because they've been so good compared to every other player the last 10, 15 years," fifth-seeded Stan Wawrinka said Saturday at the All England Club, two days before play begins, "they've been winning here every year." Somewhere, of course, there is a man who one day will win Wimbledon — and other Grand Slam titles, too.
