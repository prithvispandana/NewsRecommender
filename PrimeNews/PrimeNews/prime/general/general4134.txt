LONDON (AP) â€” Novak Djokovic's first-round match at Wimbledon lasted all of 40 minutes Tuesday. Roger Federer's, which was next in the All England Club's main stadium, went 43. When two of tennis' biggest stars crossed paths after both advanced when opponents stopped playing because of pre-existing injuries, they kidded each other about a way to try to make it up to the fans. "We had a little joke about it in the locker room," Djokovic recounted, "saying we should maybe play a practice set on the Centre Court, have the crowd stay."
