LONDON (AP) â€” Roger Federer's wait for No. 8 at Wimbledon is over. He is once again the champion of the grass-court Grand Slam tournament, now more often than any other man in the history of an event first held in 1877. Federer won his eighth title at the All England Club and 19th major trophy overall, capping a marvelous fortnight in which he never dropped a set by overwhelming Marin Cilic 6-3, 6-1, 6-4 on Sunday in a lopsided final that was more coronation than contest. When it ended, with an ace from Federer after merely 1 hour, 41 minutes, he raised both arms overhead. A minute or so later, he was sitting on the sideline, wiping tears from his eyes.
