Terrorist attacks carried out by Muslims receive more than five times as much media coverage as those carried out by non-Muslims in the US, according to anÂ academic study. Analysis of coverage of all terrorist attacks in the US between 2011 and 2015 found there was a 449 per cent increase in media attention when the perpetrator was Muslim. Muslims committed just 12.4 per cent of attacks during the period studied but received 41.4 per cent of news coverage, the survey found.
