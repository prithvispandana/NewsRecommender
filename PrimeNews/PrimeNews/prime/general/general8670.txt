BEIJING (AP) â€” A newspaper published by China's ruling Communist Party is dismissing late Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo as a political pawn of the West whose legacy will fade. The rare mention of Liu in Chinese-language media comes as international tributes flow in for the political prisoner. He died Thursday of liver cancer. The Global Times said in Friday's editorial that Liu lived a "tragic life" because he sought to confront Chinese mainstream society with outside support.
