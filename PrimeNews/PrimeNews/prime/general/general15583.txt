BARRE, Vt. (AP) â€” Gov. Phil Scott ducks into a trailer, trades his business suit for a racing jumpsuit, climbs into his modified Chevrolet and heads for Thunder Road. When his security detail drives him into the pits at the banked, quarter-mile track, he is no longer Phil Scott, the chief executive of Vermont. He is Phil Scott, long one of the state's most popular stock car racers. "It's something that's in my blood, something I've done for three or four decades," Scott said one recent Thursday before the regular summertime races at Thunder Road.
