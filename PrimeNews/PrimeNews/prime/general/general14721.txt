Warring Cabinet ministers have agreed to stop briefing against each other after being read the riot act by Theresa May, No 10 says. There was “widespread agreement” that the leaking of damaging stories from the recent weekly meeting of the Cabinet had to end, Downing Street insisted. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the “mood in the room” was that the Government was being damaged by the failure to keep its private discussions under wraps.
