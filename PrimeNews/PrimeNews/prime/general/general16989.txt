WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Thought the 2016 presidential election settled the hard-fought campaign once and for all? Not everyone is there yet. An advisory committee that President Donald Trump created to examine the integrity of U.S. voting systems held its first meeting Wednesday. And its vice chairman, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, said afterward that "we may never know" whether Trump's rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, won the popular vote through voter fraud.
