LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” It isn't easy being green. But no longer being green is apparently even harder. Steve Whitmire, the puppeteer who was fired after 27 years as Kermit the Frog said Thursday he is "devastated to have failed" Muppets founder and his mentor Jim Henson. Whitmire has been with the Muppets since 1978, and took over as Kermit after Henson died in 1990. He wrote an emotional blog post in response to his firing a day after it was made public. He said he was let go against his will, and would never have left voluntarily.
