Donald Trump’s visit to France has closed in grand style as the President watched Paris’ Bastille Day parade alongside Emmanuel Macron. Crowds packed the capital’s streets for the spectacle, which opened with French jets roaring over the city trailing red, white and blue smoke in a series of fly-pasts and a procession of singing troops and military vehicles. Some onlookers waved French flags as they passed, while others clapped and cheered the troops marching in full regalia in the July sunshine.
