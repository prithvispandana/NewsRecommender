HAVANA (AP) â€” Cuban President Raul Castro denounced President Donald Trump's tougher line on relations with Havana on Friday, calling it a setback but promising to continue working to normalize ties between the former Cold War rivals. Castro's comments to Cuba's National Assembly were his first on Trump's June announcement of a partial rollback of the Cuba-U.S. detente achieved by then-President Barack Obama. They contained echoes of the harsh rhetoric of the past. "Any strategy that seeks to destroy the revolution either through coercion or pressure or through more subtle methods will fail," Cuba's president told legislators.
