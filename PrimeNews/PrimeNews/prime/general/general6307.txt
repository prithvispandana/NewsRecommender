LONDON (AP) â€” Charlie Gard is a terminally ill British child whose parents are fighting for the right to take him to the United States for an experimental treatment. His case has gained international attention, including from Pope Francis and U.S. President Donald Trump. The 11-month-old is being treated at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital, which maintained the experimental treatment was "unjustified" and might cause Charlie more suffering without doing anything to help him. The hospital planned to take the boy off life support, but petitioned for a new court hearing based on evidence from researchers at the Vatican's children's hospital and another facility outside of Britain.
