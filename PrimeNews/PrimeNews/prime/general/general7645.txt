The Treasury's official watchdog has highlighted the significant risk posed by Brexit to the UK's public finances in a new report. The Office for Budget Responsibility, its "Fiscal Risk Report" published on Thursday, said that if Brexit ended up reducing the UK's annual trend productivity growth rate by just 0.1 per cent over 50 years, the economy would be 4.8 per cent smaller than otherwise.
