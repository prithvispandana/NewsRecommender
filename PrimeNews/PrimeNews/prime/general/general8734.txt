Donald Trump has conceded his much-touted southern wall along the US-Mexican border may end up covering less than half of the 2,000-mile frontier. The US President said natural barriers such as rivers and mountains meant a man-made structure along the entire length of the border was not necessary. He also said that some areas were so remote that a wall would not be needed.
