TONTO NATIONAL FOREST, Ariz. (AP) â€” Hector Miguel Garnica's parents were dining at the restaurant where their 27-year-old son cooked, awaiting his return from a mountain swimming hole where he was celebrating his wife's birthday in the company of three generations of their tightly knit clan. As they ate dinner, they got a phone call that brought the unthinkable. Nine relatives, including five children and their daughter-in-law, would not be returning at all. And their son, swept away in the roaring flood that killed the others, was missing. He still had not been found Monday night.
