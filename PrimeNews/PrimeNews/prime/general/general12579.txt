CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) â€” More than 7 million Venezuelans cast symbolic votes rejecting President Nicolas Maduro's plan to retool the constitution in a strong but not overwhelming showing that left the opposition facing tough choices two weeks before the socialist leader seeks to reshape the country's political system. Sunday's vote was marred by violence when a 61-year-old woman was killed and four people wounded by gunfire after government supporters on motorcycles swarmed an opposition polling site in a church in western Caracas.
