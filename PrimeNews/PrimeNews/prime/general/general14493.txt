A BBC journalist has been accused of showing a “lack of respect” over the way he “disgracefully” questioned Wimbledon semi-finalist Johanna Konta. John Humphrys had the world No 4 on his Radio 4 Today show following her best-ever showing for a British female tennis player at SW19 for 39 years. She also became only the fourth British woman in history to enter the world’s top five since they were launched in 1975.
