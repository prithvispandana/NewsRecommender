A Italian beach club venerating former fascist dictator Benito Mussolini has been raided by police.  The Punta Canna club in Chioggia, near Venice in northern Italy, is decorated with pictures of Il Duce and signs proclaiming the sight an “anti-democracy, regime run zone” and “don’t break our falls”. Other signs said: "in a country devastated by institutional and rude thieves here are the rules that are missing: order, cleanliness, discipline, severity" and “the law of justice comes from the barrel of a gun”.
