INDIANAPOLIS (AP) â€” An Indiana senator and longtime critic of outsourcing jobs to foreign countries announced Friday that he's selling his stock in his brother's arts and crafts company after The Associated Press reported it manufactures some products in Mexico. Democrat Joe Donnelly said in a campaign news release that he made the statement to reporters at the Indiana Black Expo luncheon. Donnelly said he hasn't had an active role in the company for 20 years but was taking the action to avoid allowing the issue to become "a distraction from our work to end outsourcing and keep American jobs here instead of shipping them to other countries."
