(AP) â€” A surging wildfire raced through California mountains and foothills west of Yosemite National Park on Wednesday, forcing thousands to flee tiny, Gold Rush-era towns and wafting smoky haze over the park's landmark Half Dome rock face.  The 4-day-old blaze nearly doubled in size overnight from about 40 square miles (100 kilometers) to more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers), the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.  The fire closed one of several roads into the park during its busy summer season, and rangers warned visitors with respiratory problems to be mindful of the haze, Gediman said.  Heavy smoke hung in the air over Mariposa, a town of 2,000 with century-old wooden buildings, including what's touted as the oldest active courthouse west of the Rocky Mountains.
