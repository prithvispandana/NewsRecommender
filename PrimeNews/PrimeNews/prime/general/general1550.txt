Sadiq Khan has called on Theresa May to send in commissioners to run Kensington and Chelsea council. The Prime Minister should appoint commissioners "immediately" to take over the administration of the authority as it reels in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire, Mr Khan said. The Mayor of London published a letter calling for action on his Facebook page, following the resignation of council leader Nicholas Paget-Brown and deputy leader Rock Feilding Mellen.
