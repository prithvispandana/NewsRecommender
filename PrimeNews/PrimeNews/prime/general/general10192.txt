ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) â€” When it comes to Disney, they like to keep it in the family, whether it's getting a football team's worth of original Disney princesses to cameo in "Wreck-It Ralph 2," reuniting "The Incredibles" fourteen years after the original film hit theaters, or securing a new director for "Toy Story 4." John Lasseter, the chief creative officer of Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, led a confetti, joke and song-filled presentation of the upcoming animation slate for the studio Friday at the star-studded biannual fan convention D23 in Anaheim, just steps from Disneyland with appearances of people from Kristen Bell to Samuel L. Jackson.
