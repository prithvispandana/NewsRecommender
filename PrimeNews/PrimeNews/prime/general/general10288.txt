This day has finally come and I went to shoot a lighthouse sunrise at the famous Hornby Lighthouse! It is located at the Watsons Bay, South Head. I wanted to go there for a while now, but it requires certain weather conditions to do so. 
At first, I did a few photos from the cliff top. And shortly afterward went down to the rock platform. Iâ€™ve been to this place before and knew how to get there.
