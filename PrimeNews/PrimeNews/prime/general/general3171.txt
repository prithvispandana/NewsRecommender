TRENTON, N.J. (AP) â€” Gov. Chris Christie got blistered online Monday after he was photographed sunning himself with his family on a New Jersey beach that he had closed to the public because of a government shutdown. Christie defended his use of the beach, saying he had previously announced his vacation plans and the media had simply "caught a politician keeping his word." The Republican governor was photographed Sunday by NJ.com at Island Beach State Park lounging on a beach chair in sandals and a T-shirt.
