SRINAGAR, India (AP) â€” Hours before the United States designated Kashmir rebel leader Syed Salahuddin a global terrorist, he appeared in a video calling for strikes in the Himalayan territory in remembrance of another rebel leader whose killing by Indian forces last July triggered months of deadly protests. The U.S. State Department's announcement was made Monday, shortly before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived for talks in Washington. It said Salahuddin "has committed, or poses a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism."
