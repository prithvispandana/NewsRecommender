More than a dozen homes in South Yorkshire will need to be demolished to make way for the new HS2 rail line after the Government unveiled the route for the section phase of the £55.7 billion project. The eastern section of the line, linking Birmingham and Leeds via Sheffield, will go through a newly-built housing estate. Sixteen properties in Mexborough will be bulldozed to make way for the high-speed railway, the Department for Transport (DfT) said.
