One of the first police officers to respond to the Grenfell Tower fire has described the horror of watching the building “melting” as trapped residents pressed themselves up against windows screaming for help. Inspector Nick Thatcher said he had to prevent fellow officers as well as desperate members of the public running back inside in attempts to save the victims. "They were trying to help but there was nothing they could do,” he said.
