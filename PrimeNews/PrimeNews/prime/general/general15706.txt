The boy, Vishal, was playing football on July 10 when he twisted his ankle. He was rushed to the NDMC hospital in Moti Bagh where the doctors put a plaster on the injured leg because there was swelling and pain. A day later, when the pain persisted, Vishal was rushed to the hospital again and doctors prescribed painkillers.
