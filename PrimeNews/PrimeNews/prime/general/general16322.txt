SALEM, Mass. (AP) â€” Five women hanged during the Salem witch trials in Massachusetts are being remembered on the 325th anniversary of their deaths. Salem planned a Wednesday ceremony at Proctor's Ledge where Sarah Good, Elizabeth Howe, Susannah Martin, Rebecca Nurse and Sarah Wildes were hanged as witches on July 19, 1692. It was the first of three mass executions at the site. The ceremony includes the dedication of a semi-circular stone wall memorial inscribed with the names of the 19 people hanged near Proctor's Ledge, which scholars last year confirmed as the site of the hangings. Besides the 19 hangings, one man was crushed to death by rocks and five people accused of witchcraft died in jail.
