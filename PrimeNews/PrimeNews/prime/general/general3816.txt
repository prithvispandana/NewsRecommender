VATICAN CITY (AP) â€” The Vatican's children's hospital is releasing its annual report after denouncing as a "hoax" an Associated Press investigation that found its mission shifted under its past administration to focus more on profits than on its small patients. The president of the Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital and senior medical officials were scheduled to present the report Tuesday in the presence of the Vatican secretary of state and Italy's health minister.
