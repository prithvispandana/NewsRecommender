Donald Trump has said he probed Vladimir Putin for almost half an hour over whether the Russian President meddled in last November's US election. The pair met for talks lasting more than two hours last week during the G20 summit in Hamburg.  Mr Trump claimed he questioned his Russian counterpart for the first 20 or 25 minutes of the meeting, asking Mr Putin if he was involved in what US intelligence believe was meddling in the presidential campaign.
