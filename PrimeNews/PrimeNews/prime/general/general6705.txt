A 20-year-old linked to a Pennsylvania farm at the center of a search for four missing men was arrested Wednesday on charges he tried to sell one man's car after he went missing, even as it contained the man's "life-saving" diabetic kit, authorities said in announcing the first big break in the case. Tom Meo, 21, never went anywhere without the medicine, a prosecutor said as the search intensified. Meo and two others were last seen in suburban Philadelphia on Friday, while the fourth vanished two days earlier.
