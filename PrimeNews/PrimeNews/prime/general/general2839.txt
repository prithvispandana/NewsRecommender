BERLIN (AP) â€” Eighteen people are feared dead after a bus carrying a group of German senior citizens crashed into a truck on a highway in Bavaria early Monday and burst into flames, police said. Thirty people were injured in the early-morning accident, some seriously, while 18 still considered missing "are believed to have died on the burning bus," police said in a statement. Authorities said that forensic specialists were being brought in from Germany's federal police office to remove and identify the bodies from the charred vehicle. Police spokeswoman Irene Brandenstein said the work was slow and labor intensive given how badly damaged the bus was by the fire.
