CAIRO (AP) â€” Two German female tourists were stabbed to death while four other foreigners were wounded in an attack Friday at a hotel in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Hurghada, an Egyptian security official said. The assault came just hours after a shooting near some of Egypt's most famous pyramids outside of Cairo killed five policemen. The motive behind the stabbing was unclear and the Interior Ministry said the attacker at the Red Sea resort was arrested immediately. A security official said the attacker, a man in his 20s dressed in a black T-shirt and jeans, wielded a knife and intentionally sought to attack foreigners.
