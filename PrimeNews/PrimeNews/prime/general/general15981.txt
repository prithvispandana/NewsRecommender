Theresa May is preparing to face Jeremy Corbyn over the despatch box for the last time this parliamentary year. After a tumultuous year in Parliament, which included a general election, the triggering of Article 50 and the start of Brexit negotiations, both party leaders will be relieved to have survived the last 12 months. Mr Corbyn undoubtedly goes into the summer recess in a stronger position than Ms May, who was weakened by a disastrous election result.
