On good days, American high jumper Jamie Nieto can shuffle 130 steps without a cane or walker. It's an important distance — about the length from the altar to the church door. His vow: Make it all the way, under his own power, when he's married on July 22. The two-time Olympian is recovering from a spinal cord injury he suffered on a misjudged backflip in April 2016. The accident initially left him with no feeling in his hands and feet. Walking? Doctors couldn't predict if he would take more than a few steps — or any at all.
