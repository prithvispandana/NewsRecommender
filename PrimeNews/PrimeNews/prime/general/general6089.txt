LONDON (AP) â€” A British court on Monday gave the parents of 11-month-old Charlie Gard a chance to present fresh evidence that their terminally ill son should receive experimental treatment. Judge Nicholas Francis gave the couple until Wednesday afternoon to present the evidence and set a new hearing for Thursday. The decision came after an emotionally charged hearing in which Gard's mother wept in frustration and his father yelled at a lawyer. The re-opening of the case at London's High Court may allow Charlie to receive the therapy treatment at his current hospital or abroad.
