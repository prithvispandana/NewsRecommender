MOSUL, Iraq (AP) â€” Iraqi troops celebrated after driving Islamic State militants from some of their last strongholds in Mosul on Sunday, but heavy fighting continued just a few blocks away. Lt. Gen. Jassim Nizal of the army's 9th Division said his forces have achieved "victory" in their sector, after a similar announcement by the militarized Federal Police. His soldiers danced to patriotic music atop tanks even as airstrikes sent plumes of smoke into the air nearby. Iraq launched the operation to retake Mosul in October. IS now controls less than a square kilometer (mile) of territory in Mosul's Old City, but is using human shields, suicide bombers and snipers in a fight to the death.
