WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Republicans in Washington have been clamoring for years to address the long-term financial problems of Social Security and Medicare. On Thursday, the trustees who oversee the programs are scheduled to issue their annual warning about the finances of the federal government's two largest benefit programs. Don't expect Republicans to do much about it. Over the years, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has insisted on overhauling the benefit programs, proposing a voucher-like system for Medicare and calling for partially privatizing Social Security.
