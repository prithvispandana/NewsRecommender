The probe agency had claimed that the FDI proposal of INX Media was “fallacious,” but cleared by then finance minister P Chodambaram. The media house roped in a company owned by Karti Chidambaram for consultancy. Its proposal was cleared by FIPB “by virtue of influence exercised over them by Karti P Chidambaram," it said in the FIR.
