The final photo taken by a 14-year-old girl who was electrocuted while using her mobile in the bath has been released as a warning to others.  Madison Coe, from Lovington, New Mexico, sent a text message to a friend of her phone plugged into an extension cord just moments before she died. “When you use and (sic) extension cord so you can plug in your phone while you're in the bath,” the text read.
