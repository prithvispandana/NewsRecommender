Jeremy Corbyn has sacked several members of his frontbench team after a party split in the Commons about how to oppose the Government on Brexit. Three shadow ministers were sacked and at least one more resigned after they joined a total of 49 MPs who supported a rebel amendment to the Queen’s Speech calling for Britain to stay in the single market and customs union. Catherine West, Ruth Cadbury and Andy Slaughter were sacked from the front bench. Another MP, Daniel Zeichner announced this evening that he resigned ahead of the vote.
