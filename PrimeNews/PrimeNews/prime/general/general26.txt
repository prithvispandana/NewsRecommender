LONDON (AP) â€” Britain's government said local officials across the country Sunday should urgently submit samples of exterior panels from apartment towers after authorities found that all samples tested so far have failed fire safety standards. In London, officials trying to avoid another fire disaster after the fast-moving blaze killed at least people at Grenfell Tower sought Sunday to complete the evacuation of hundreds of apartments in four towers deemed unsafe. They faced resistance as several families refused to budge.
