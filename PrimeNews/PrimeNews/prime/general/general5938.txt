More than 250 Grenfell Tower residents survived the devastating fire that killed at least 80 people last month, according to police.Â  Police said investigations had led them to conclude 350 people lived in the west London tower but 14 were not there when the building went up in flames on 14 June. Authorities believe 255 people escaped and 80 are still estimated to have died or are missing.
