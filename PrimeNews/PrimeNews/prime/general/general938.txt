A Conservative MP has refused to appear on Channel 4 News, saying he “couldn’t be sure” of its impartiality because of the apparent political leanings of veteran presenter Jon Snow. Former Tory chairman Grant Shapps said he declined an offer to go on the programme after Snow was alleged to have shouted “f*** the Tories” while dancing with a group of students at Glastonbury Festival.
