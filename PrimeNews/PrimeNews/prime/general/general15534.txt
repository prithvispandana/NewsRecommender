A customer has been barred from buying a sandwich and a soft drink for a homeless man by a Coffee Costa barista. Adrian Pinsent attempted to buy food for him in Waterloo station but was rebuffed by a member of staff at the second largest coffeehouse chain worldwide. Footage shows the barista falsely claiming they would be “prosecuted” if they sold him the snack because it went against station “policy”. In the wake of the incident, Network Rail, which manages Waterloo station, and British Transport Police have made it clear they have no such a policy in place.
