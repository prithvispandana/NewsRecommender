MOSUL, Iraq (AP) â€” Iraqi troops were clearing up a key neighborhood in Mosul on Friday, commanders said, a day after making significant gains against Islamic State militants in the city and after the country's prime minister declared an end to the extremist group's self-proclaimed caliphate. Lt. Gen. Abdul Wahab al-Saadi and Lt. Col. Salam Hussein told The Associated Press their forces were continuing to clear territory in the Old City after retaking the hugely symbolic al-Nuri Mosque on Thursday, following a dawn push into the Mosul neighborhood.
