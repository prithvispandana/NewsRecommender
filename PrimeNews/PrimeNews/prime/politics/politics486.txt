SEVNICA, Slovenia -- Janez Levstik offers a bright smile and a firm handshake when he greets visitors at the information center in the heart of Sevnica, a hamlet of 5,000 in southeastern Slovenia. The tours he leads these days, however, arenâ€™t to the medieval castle (Gard Sevnica) or hilltops with views of the picturesque River Sava that runs through the heart of town.
