Francesco Totti has confirmed his retirement as a player by accepting a directorship role with Roma. The 40-year-old Roman, who represented the Giallorossi for 24 years as a striker, played his last game for the Serie A club in May but his status since had been uncertain as he fielded offers. In an interview published on Roma's official website on Monday evening, Totti admitted his illustrious on-pitch career was a thing of the past and that a new life in football management awaited him.
