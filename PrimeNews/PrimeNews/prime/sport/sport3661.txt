Besiktas want to sign Manchester United forward Anthony Martial on loan. The France international endured a mixed campaign under Jose Mourinho last season and he has recently been linked with a move away. The 21-year-old is reportedly eager for more first-team football and it has been reported he maybe allowed to leave on loan. LyonÂ have expressed an interest in Martial but now, according to Milliyet, Besiktas are also keen too. The Turkish giants are tracking the former Monaco man and are ready to swoop if he is given the green light to leave.
