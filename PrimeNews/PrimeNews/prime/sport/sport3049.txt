Arsene Wenger insists Arsenal have not made any offers for Kylian Mbappe this summer and he expects the Monaco starlet to stay put for another season.  The 18-year-old enjoyed a stunning breakthrough campaign in 2016-17, firing 26 goals in all competitions to help his side win Ligue 1 and reach the Champions League semi-finals. He has been linked with some of Europe's biggest clubs, and it was recently claimed that Arsenal had tabled a stunning £100million offer to Monaco for the youngster.
