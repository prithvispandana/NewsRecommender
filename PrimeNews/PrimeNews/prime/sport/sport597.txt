Arsenal's 19-year-old forward Chris Willock has joined Benfica. The England Under-19 international, who has not made a Premier League appearance for the Gunners, has moved to the Portuguese side on a five-year deal. "I hope I can show what I can do on the pitch. I think we have a great team and we can achieve great things in the future," Willock said on the Benfica website.
