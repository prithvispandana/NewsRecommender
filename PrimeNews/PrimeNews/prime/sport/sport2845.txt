Jose Mourinho has not closed the door on a new deal for Zlatan Ibrahimovic or a move for Chelsea's Nemanja Matic, admitting Manchester United's summer business is only 50 per cent complete. Significant knee ligament damage brought Ibrahimovic's outstanding first campaign at Old Trafford to an abrupt halt in April, with the Swede released at the end of his one-year deal. It was little surprise given the 35-year-old's huge wages and inability to play until next year, but the striker has stayed on at United to do his rehabilitation and could yet have a future at the club.
