RB Leipzig chief executive Oliver Mintzlaff admits he is "bored" by constant speculation surrounding midfielder Naby Keita. The Guinea international is a target for Liverpool, who are prepared to smash their transfer record to acquire him, after just one season with the Bundesliga club and there are conflicting reports about the player's future. Although the transfer window has only just officially opened, Mintzlaff has had enough of all the talk, even though he is powerless to prevent it.
