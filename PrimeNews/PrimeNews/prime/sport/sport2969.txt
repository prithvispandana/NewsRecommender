Manchester City's new signing Kyle Walker wants to add multiple trophies to a CV lacking silverware after joining from Tottenham in a deal that could reach £50million. The England right-back, 27, was confirmed as City's third signing of the summer on Friday for an initial fee of £45m, with Spurs due another £5m if various add-on clauses are met.
