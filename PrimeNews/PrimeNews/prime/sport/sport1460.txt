Barrie McKay has completed his move to Nottingham Forest and been reunited with former Rangers manager Mark Warburton. The Championship club confirmed the winger had signed a four-year contract after moving for an undisclosed fee which is believed to be an initial £500,000 plus potential add-ons. The 22-year-old had been increasingly sidelined by Warburton's Ibrox successor, Pedro Caixinha, and was recently training with the under-20s.
