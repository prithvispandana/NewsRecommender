Kurt Angle finally dropped his mystery bombshell on the WWE Universe last night on Monday Night Raw as he revealed that he’s the father of Jason Jordan.   An emotional Angle confessed to the Nashville crowd that Jordan was a product of a relationship between him and a former college flame, but didn’t know about the birth of his son until very recently, since Jordan had been raised by his adopted parents. The new father and son embraced publicly for the first time as Angle welcomed his offspring to the Monday Night Raw brand.
