Glamorgan v Sussex A record-breaking century by Colin Ingram at Arundel propelled Glamorgan to their first victory in this season's T20 Blast. Glamorgan, who were beaten by Hampshire in their opening fixture on Friday, beat Sussex by 18 runs, despite the almost equally-brutal Luke Wright equalling Ingram's score of 101. Ingram's century was the fastest in the county's history in this competition. He reached his hundred from just 46 balls, and there were eight fours and seven sixes.
