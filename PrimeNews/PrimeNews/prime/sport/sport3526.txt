Virgil van Dijkâ€™s proposed switch to Liverpool is STILL ON, with the defending willing to force through his dream move to Anfield this summer, according to reports. The Dutchman was heavily linked with a move to Anfield before the transfer window opened, but the deal looked dead after Southampton accused the Merseyside club of illegally tapping up their star man. Liverpool responded with statement insisting they had ended their pursuit, but after a Premier League investigation excused the Reds of any wrongdoing, it is understood they are back in the hunt.
