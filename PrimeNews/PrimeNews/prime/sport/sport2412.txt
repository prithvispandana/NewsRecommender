Ron-Robert Zieler had a debut to forget after completing a permanent move back to Germany. The 28-year-old goalkeeper ended his one-year stay at Leicester City after joining Bundesliga side Stuttgart on a three-year deal. He made just 13 appearances for the Foxes in all competitions last term after his arrival from Hannover.
