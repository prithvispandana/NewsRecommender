Floyd Mayweather has revealed why he agreed to a fight with MMA star Conor McGregor, telling talkSPORT the three reasons a clash could be scheduled. A fight between the pair was rumoured for a number of months before it was finally announced in June after an agreement had been found; Las Vegas will host the clash on August 26. Mayweather is going for his 50th win, and he made it clear only a fight with McGregor would make him come out of retirement, while McGregor will take part in the biggest payday in his career by switching sports.
