Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is not nervous about their lack of transfer business so far. While Merseyside rivals Everton have spent almost £100million so far the Reds boss has signed Roma winger Mohamed Salah for £34.3m and brought in England Under-20 World Cup-winner Dominic Solanke after his contract expired with Chelsea. The likes of both Manchester clubs and Arsenal have all made big-money signings but Klopp is confident in their approach.
