Liverpool's pursuit of RB Leipzig midfielder Naby Keita may now be over after the Bundesliga side effectively sent a ‘hands off’ message to the Reds. Jurgen Klopp's long-held interest in the Guinea international is well known and has led to much speculation about the 22-year-old's future this summer. However, Leipzig have been steadfast in their stance that he will not be sold and it is understood they have contacted Liverpool to re-emphasise their stance.
