Chelsea and Manchester United target Mattia De Sciglio has joined Juventus' pre-season training camp, ahead of his proposed move from AC Milan. The 24-year-old full-back, who was a target for both Premier League sides this summer, has been allowed to leave Milan's camp in China to complete a reported £9million switch. And reports in Italy have claimed De Sciglio has said his last goodbyes to Milan team-mates before linking up with Juventus.
