West Brom have strengthened their defensive options with the signing of Egypt international Ahmed Hegazi. Albion have been tracking the 26-year-old centre-half since his performances caught their eye during the African Nations Cup at the start of the year. Hegazi has moved to the Hawthorns on a year-long loan but West Brom have the option to make it a permanent deal.
