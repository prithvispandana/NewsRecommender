Former Manchester City defender Matija Nastasic is on the verge of completing a move to Roma, according to reports in Italy. The Schalke centre-back, who spent three years at City before joining the German side in 2015, is expected to complete the move within the next 24 hours. Nastasic, 24, was a prominent figure for the Bundesliga giants last season, racking up 35 appearances in all competitions. And, according to the Corriere dello Sport, his stellar performances are set to be rewarded with a multi-million pound switch to Roma.
