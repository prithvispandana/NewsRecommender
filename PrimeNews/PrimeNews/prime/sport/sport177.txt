Bayern Munich are the third European heavyweight to be linked with Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea target Ousmane Dembele this summer. The young French star only joined Borussia Dortmund 12 months ago but he is being heavily linked with a £79million move away during this window. Both Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain are said to be very keen on signing Dembele and may be ready to stump up the lofty transfer fee. And now, according to Bild, Bayern are also monitoring the situation closely and could be about to lodge a formal offer of their own.
