Ryan Giggs has told talkSPORT he is not waiting for a Premier League job, and is willing to look further down the English football pyramid to be given a managerial opportunity. The Manchester United legend has deniedÂ claims he is refusing to entertain talks with clubs in the Championship and below, as he believes he deserves a chance to manage at the highest level of the game. Nottingham Forest are one club said to have sounded out Giggs, 43, over becoming their new head coach in early 2017, but nothing came of the rumoured approach.
