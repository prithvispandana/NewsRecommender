Manchester City are set to land Kyle Walker for a huge £50million fee, making him the world’s most expensive player. At 27-years-old, Walker is entering the peak of his career and has chosen to do so under the tutelage of Pep Guardiola, one of Europe’s finest managers. Some stars hit their best form at different ages, players like Wayne Rooney had their best days in their mid-20s, but others like Gianluigi Buffon can save their best days until they’re 30, or even older.
