Hurricanes v Lions is live on talkSPORT at 8.30am (BST) on Tuesday 27 June. Warren Gatland will ask referees to clamp down on New Zealand'sÂ "dangerous" harassment of Conor Murray's kicking game. British and Irish Lions boss Gatland was left frustrated with what he felt were deliberate tactics from the hosts' diving "blindly" at Murray's standing leg whenever he launched a box kick in Saturday's 30-15 defeat.
