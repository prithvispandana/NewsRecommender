Athletic Bilbao are considering a move for Arsenal full-back Nacho Monreal during the summer window, according to reports in Spain. The Spanish side have prioritised the signing of full-backs during the transfer window and believe the 31-year-old would be the ideal addition. The Gunners may allow Monreal to leave after completing a deal for left-back Sead Kolasinac earlier in the window, with Bilbao waiting with anticipation.
