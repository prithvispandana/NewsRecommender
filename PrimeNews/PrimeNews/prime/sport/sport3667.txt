Arsenal defender Mathieu Debuchy is undergoing a medical ahead of a move to Nice. The Frenchman has fallen down the pecking order at the Gunners and he has been itching to leave for some time. The right-back enjoyed a spell on loan at Bordeaux in 2016 and it was thought he may return to Les Girondins. But, according to RMC, Debuchy is set to join Nice and he is currently having a medical there. The 31-year-old is under contract with Arsenal until 2019Â but is expected to sign for the French side on a free transfer.
