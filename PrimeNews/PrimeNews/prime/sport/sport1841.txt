Tottenham have insisted they are not in takeover talks amid claims that a potential buyer backed by Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg could be preparing a Â£1billion bid. Reports have suggested American investment company Iconiq Capital are interested in the White Hart Lane outfit, which finished second in the Premier League last season. However, Spurs, who are currently in the process of building a new stadium next to their current home, moved to dispel speculation that the club could be for sale.
