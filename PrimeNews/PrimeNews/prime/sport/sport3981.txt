Sadio Mane will join Liverpool's pre-season trip to Germany after being cleared to resume full training next week. The Senegal forward underwent surgery in April having damaged the meniscus in his left knee, and was excluded from the squad which on Sunday travelled to Hong Kong. Liverpool are scheduled to face Hertha Berlin in a friendly on July 29 before participating in the Audi Cup, which also includes Bayern Munich, and boss Jurgen Klopp expects to have the 25-year-old available.
