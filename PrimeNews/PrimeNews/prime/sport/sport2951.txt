Liverpool are close to completing the signing of Hull City left-back Andrew Robertson. The Reds are understood to have an agreed an £8million deal with Hull for the Scotland international. Jurgen Klopp has been searching for a new left-back to provide competition to James Milner, who impressed in the role last season despite having spent most of his career as a midfielder. Robertson has been a solid performer for Hull since arriving from Dundee United in 2014.
