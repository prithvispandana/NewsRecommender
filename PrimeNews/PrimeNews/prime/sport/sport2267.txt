Luke Shaw can nail down the role as Manchester United's first-choice left-back if he wants it enough, according to Denis Irwin, one of the club's great full-backs. Just three months ago the England international's Old Trafford future looked bleak after Jose Mourinho publicly eviscerated him, calling into question his commitment and focus. Shaw had a meeting with the United manager in the wake of those scathing comments and quickly set about winning him over, only for progress to be halted by ligament damage in his foot.
