Sunderland have announced the double signing of Aiden McGeady and James Vaughan. Republic of Ireland winger McGeady joins from Everton on a three-year deal and, given how he impressed for Preston in the Championship last season, will offer Sunderland fans hope of an immediate return to the Premier League. McGeady worked with new boss Simon Grayson during his loan spell at Deepdale, and the manager told his club's official website: "Aiden's career speaks volumes. He's been an exceptional player and was an outstanding performer at Preston last season."
