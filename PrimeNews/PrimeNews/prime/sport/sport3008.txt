Lewis Hamilton delighted the Silverstone crowd with a crushing performance in qualifying to secure pole position for Sunday's British Grand Prix. Hamilton, who is 20 points behind Sebastian Vettel in the race for this year's championship, finished more than half-a-second clear of his nearest challenger as he bids to win his home race for a record-equalling fifth time. Kimi Raikkonen will start in second place with Hamilton's title rival Vettel only third.
