Leicester City and Southampton are tracking Valencia defender Aymen Abdennour. The 27-year-old has been linked with a move to the Premier League for over a year now and he was reportedly close to joining Everton last August. That deal, however, ending up collapsing and the Algerian has more recently been on Marseille's radar. The French club are fans of Abdennour and manager Rudi Garcia is eager to takeÂ him to the Stade Velodrome this summer.
