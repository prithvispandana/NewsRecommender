Nice left-back Dalbert wants to leave the club amid interest from Arsenal and Inter Milan. The 23-year-old enjoyed a brilliant debut campaign in France last season after arriving from Portuguese club Vitoria de Guimaraes last summer. Clubs from around Europe have taken notice of the Brazilian's performances and there are reports Arsenal and Inter Milan will make their moves this summer. Both sides are said to have scouted Dalbert over the past 12 months and they've been impressed by what they've seen.
