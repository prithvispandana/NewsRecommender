Andy Murray backed fellow British star Johanna Konta to win Wimbledon after he crashed out of the men's singles.  The defending champion said he had tried his best "right to the end" after losing to American Sam Querrey on Centre Court in his 10th quarter-final at the tournament.  The defeat comes one day after Konta became the first British woman to make it to the semi-finals of Wimbledon since Virginia Wade in 1978.
