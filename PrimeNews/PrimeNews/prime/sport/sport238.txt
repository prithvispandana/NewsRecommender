Arsenal's pursuit of Barcelona winger Arda Turan has received a major boost after Besiktas pulled out of the running to sign him. The Super Lig giants were hopeful of luring Turan back to his homeland this summer with his first-team opportunities at the Nou Camp limited. But, according to Spanish newspaper Marca, Besiktas have balked at the Â£26.5million asking price and they will now turn their attentions to other targets. That will come as good news to Arsenal who have been extensively linked with the 30-year-old over the past 12 months.
