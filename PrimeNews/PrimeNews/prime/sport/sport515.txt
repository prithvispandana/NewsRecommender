Sunderland captain John O’Shea has signed a new one-year deal with the club, new manager Simon Grayson confirmed. The Republic of Ireland international has been with the Black Cats since 2011 after 12 successful years plying his trade with Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United. The central defender made 28 appearances last season as Sunderland were relegated from the Premier League under David Moyes.
