England reached the Women's World Cup final by winning a nerve-shredding contest against South Africa with only two balls to spare. Anya Shrubsole hit the decisive boundary to seal a two-wicket win for England, who were left needing two runs from the last three balls of a dramatic contest in Bristol. South Africa had earlier set England a target of 219 to win after Laura Wolvaardt (66) and the unbeaten Mignon du Preez (76) had given the underdogs hope of a shock victory.
