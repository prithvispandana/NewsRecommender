Romelu Lukaku is a signing who will improve his all-round game and suit Manchester United’s style under Jose Mourinho, according to Rene Meulensteen. The 24-year-old is close to an Old Trafford switch after the two clubs agreed a fee for his transfer. The Everton forward is expected to cost around £75million, and will be the Europa League and EFL Cup winners’ first-choice striker after the departure of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
