Germany shocked Spain to win the Euro 2017 title as Mitchell Weiser's header clinched glory.  Hertha Berlin wideman Weiser's 40th-minute winner gave Germany a deserved 1-0 victory in Friday's final in Krakow. Disappointing Spain were chasing a record-equalling fifth title but rarely looked like winning their third crown in four tournaments.  Five-goal top scorer Saul Niguez and Real Madrid wonderkid Marco Asensio barely made an impact as Germany, who beat England in the semi finals, shut them out.
