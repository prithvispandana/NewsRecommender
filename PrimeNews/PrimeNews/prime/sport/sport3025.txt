Garbine Muguruza won a battle of the generations by thrashing Venus Williams to secure her first Wimbledon title. Williams, 37, was bidding to become the oldest female grand slam singles winner in the open era but Muguruza, 14 years her junior, delivered an emphatic 7-5 6-0 victory. It is Muguruza's second major title, adding to the French Open crown she won last year, and makes her the first Spanish woman to win the singles here since her coach Conchita Martinez in 1994.
