Worcestershire paceman Josh Tongue has signed a new four-year deal at New Road. The 19-year-old academy product has taken 30 Specsavers County Championship wickets at 24.26 this season, including a career-best six for 97 against Glamorgan. Director of cricket Steve Rhodes appeared to reference the recent departure of Tom Kohler-Cadmore to Yorkshire, as well as rumours around other possible departures, in trumpeting the news. "Tongue's signing will be a real nice tonic for people who question our ability to hang onto players," he said.
