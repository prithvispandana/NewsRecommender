Harry Arter has signed a new four-year contract at Bournemouth.  The midfielder has committed his future to the Cherries until 2021, the club have announced.  Arter only signed a fresh three-year deal last summer following the club's first season in the Premier League.  The 27-year-old, who joined from Woking in 2010, told the club's official site: "Once I heard the club wanted to give me a new deal, it was a pretty easy decision.  "The team has been successful over the last few years and you want to be part of somewhere that is continually progressing.
