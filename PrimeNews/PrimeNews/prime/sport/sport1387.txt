A rematch between Anthony Joshua and Wladimir Klitschko could be held in Las Vegas if it isÂ not in Britain, Eddie Hearn told talkSPORT. It is believed Klitschko will only agree to another fight with the reigning world heavyweight champion as long as it is held outside the United Kingdom. Wembley Stadium played host to the April fight that saw AJ claim the WBA (Super) and IBO heavyweight titles to become unified world champion, adding those two belts to his IBF title.
