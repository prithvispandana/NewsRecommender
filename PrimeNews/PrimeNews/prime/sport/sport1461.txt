Former Tottenham flop Yuri Berchiche is on the verge of a lucrative move to French giants Paris Saint-Germain. The 27-year-old Real Sociedad full-back failed to make a first-team appearance for Spurs during his three-year stay at the club and was even loaned out to Cheltenham Town in 2009. But his stock has risen steadily since those days and he is now on the cusp of a switch to one of the world's biggest clubs. According to Le Parisien, Berchiche has agreed a four-year deal with PSG, who are set to pay Real Sociedad around Â£12m to land him.
