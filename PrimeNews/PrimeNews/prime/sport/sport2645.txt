Tottenham are ready to splash £19million on former Liverpool attacking midfielder Suso. Spurs have been tracking the 23-year-old all summer after being impressed with his performances for AC Milan last season. Until now, though, Tottenham have not made a serious offer but, with Kyle Walker sent to join Manchester City for £50m, they have money to spend. And, according to reports in Italy, Spurs are ready to set aside £19m of their transfer kitty to prise Suso away from Milan.
