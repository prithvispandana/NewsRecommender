Olivier Giroud's time at Arsenal is over, according to former Gunner Stewart Robson. The striker has fired 98 goals in 226 appearances for the north London club since his arrival from Montpellier in 2012. But his future is in doubt following the arrival of fellow France international Alexandre Lacazette, and Robson believes a move away from Arsenal is in everyone’s best interests. Speaking on the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast, Robson said: "With Lacazette coming in, Welbeck still a good player when he is fully fit, I just don't think there is room for Olivier Giroud.
