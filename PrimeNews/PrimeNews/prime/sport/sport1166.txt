Michael Keane has completed his move to Everton in a deal which could rise to a club record-equalling £30million. The 24-year-old Burnley defender has signed a five-year deal and becomes the club's fifth summer signing after Jordan Pickford, Davy Klaassen, Henry Onyekuru and Sandro Ramirez, whose move from Malaga was announced earlier on Monday. Everton announced the news via their official Twitter account, posting: "We've signed Michael Keane on a five-year deal for a fee which could rise to a club-record £30m."
