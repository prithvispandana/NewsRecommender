Everton have revealed the number that will adorn the shirt worn by returning Wayne Rooney next season. The 31-year-old England star returned to the club where he began his career, from Manchester United on Sunday, and will turn out for Ronald Koemanâ€™s side with the familiar number 10 on his back. Rooney will also be following in the footsteps of childhood hero Duncan Ferguson who wore the number during his second spell at the club.
