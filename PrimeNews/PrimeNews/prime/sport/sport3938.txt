Kieran Trippier has signed a new five-year deal with Tottenham, the club have announced. The 26-year-old right-back has been back-up to Kyle Walker for the past two seasons, making just 18 Premier League appearances since arriving from Burnley in a £3.5million deal in 2015. But he is set to be elevated to first-choice by boss Mauricio Pochettino this term following Walker's £50m move to Manchester City.
