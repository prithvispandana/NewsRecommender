Out-of-favour Chelsea striker Michy Batshuayi has hinted he could stay at Stamford Bridge next season this summer, after turning down the chance to join Turkish giants Fenerbahce. The Belgium international struggled for regular first-team football under Antonio Conte last season following his £35million arrival from Marseille. Batshuayi only managed 239 minutes in the Premier League last season and there were suggestions the striker could leave after just one campaign.
