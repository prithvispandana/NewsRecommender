Taulupe Faletau believes that Maro Itoje has "put a marker down in world rugby" with his performances on the British and Irish Lions' New Zealand tour. England lock Itoje was the Lions' outstanding performer in their Test series-levelling victory over the All Blacks three days ago, helping to set up an Eden Park decider this weekend. It proved to be the latest high point in a career that has already reaped two Six Nations titles, a Grand Slam, European Champions Cup and Aviva Premiership success, plus a World Under-20 Championship.
