The 1992 Summer Olympics produced a great many heroes, but that spring TV viewers were led to believe they were all about Dan O'Brien and Dave Johnson -- decathletes competing not only for the USA but for Reebok, as well. 25 years later, we revisit the hype, how the campaign went bust -- and Dan O'Brien's path to redemption. Hosted by Jody Avirgan. Produced by Andrew Mambo. 30for30podcasts.com
