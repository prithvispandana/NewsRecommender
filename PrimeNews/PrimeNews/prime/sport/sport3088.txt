Chelsea are close to sealing the Â£65m signing of Borussia Dortmund forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. With Diego Costa set to depart Stamford Bridge this summer, Antonio Conte has been on the look out for a new striker. The Blues missed out on Romelu Lukaku, with the Belgium international signing for Manchester United, and various reports have linked the west London club with the likes of Alvaro Morata, Gonzalo Higuain and Andrea Belotti in recent weeks.
