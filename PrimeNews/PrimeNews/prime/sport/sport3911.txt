Rangers have been fined by UEFA after fans were found to be guilty of throwing objects onto the pitch during last month's Europa League first leg against Progres Niederkorn at Ibrox. The Glasgow outfit, who were knocked out of the competition after surprisingly losing 2-1 on aggregate to the Luxembourg minnows in the first qualifying round, have been ordered to pay 7,000 euros (Â£6,200) for the behaviour of their fans.
