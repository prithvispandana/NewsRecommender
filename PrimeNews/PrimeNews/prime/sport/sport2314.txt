Arsenal got their pre-season tour off to a winning start by beating Sydney FC 2-0 in Australia and Alexandre Lacazette scored his first goal for the club. The Gunners recently paid Lyon Â£52m for the striker, who started the friendly on the bench and was introduced when the club were 1-0 ahead thanks to an earlier Per Mertesacker goal.
