Torino coach Sinisa Mihajlovic has told Andrea Belotti to snub interest from Chelsea and Manchester United and stay where he is. The striker was one of the best players in Italy last season and he finished the campaign with 26 Serie A goals to his name. Several clubs from around Europe are now exploring the possibility of signing the Italian this summer and he has a €100million [£87mi] release-clause, which can only be activated by foreign clubs.
