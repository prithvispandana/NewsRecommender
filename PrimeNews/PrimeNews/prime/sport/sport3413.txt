Mark Percival's 22-point haul ensured St Helens ran out 46-28 winners against Catalans Dragons in a frenetic Super League clash. The England centre kicked nine goals and went over for the decisive score in the closing stages. The result was only made certain late on as Saints steamed over for three tries in six minutes. Steve McNamara's Dragons were excellent value for the 28 points they plundered and but for a final-quarter collapse could have taken the win themselves.
