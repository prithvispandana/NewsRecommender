Australian cyclist Richie Porte is out of the Tour de France following a horror 45mph crash during stage nine. The 32-year-old was one of the pre-tour favourites, and a main challenger to Britain’s Chris Froome, but has been taken to hospital following the incident that occurred while speeding downhill. The BMC racing rider was travelling at 72.5kph (45mph) when he clipped a grass verge on the inside of a left-hand bend. He was subsequently flung from his bike before hitting a wall and colliding with rival rider Dan Martin.
