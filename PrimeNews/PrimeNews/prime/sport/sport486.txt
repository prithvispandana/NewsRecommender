Liverpool's Mohamed Salah and Chelsea have been cleared of wrongdoing after the Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed a complaint brought by Fiorentina. Salah, who recently joined Liverpool from Roma, joined Fiorentina on loan from Chelsea in January 2015 for the remainder of the 2014-15 season. But Fiorentina alleged breach of contract when the Egpyt winger instead moved to Roma on loan for the 2015-16 season in a deal which later became permanent. FIFA threw out the complaint in May 2016 and, 13 months on, CAS has come to the same conclusion.
