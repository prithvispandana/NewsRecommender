Exeter have announced a coaching reshuffle after Rob Baxter signed a new deal to become the Chiefs' director of rugby. The 46-year-old had previously held the role of head coach at the Aviva Premiership side but will now occupy a new position at the club, penning a three-year deal. Ali Hepher, who also signed on for another three years, will now fulfil the head coach role while fellow coaches Rob Hunter and Ricky Pellow will remain having both agreed new contracts.
