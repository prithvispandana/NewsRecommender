Gianluigi Donnarumma's family have told him to stay at AC Milan and forget about interest from Manchester United and Real Madrid, according to reports in Italy. The goalkeeper is currently locked in contract talks with Milan as he enters the final year of his deal. Originally it had been reported the 18-year-old would sign fresh terms with the San Siro club but negotiations have gone south and the player's agent, Mino Raiola, claims his client has been bullied.
