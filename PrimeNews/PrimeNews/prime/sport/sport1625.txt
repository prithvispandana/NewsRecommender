A final-quarter rally from champions Wigan earned them a 32-10 at Catalans Dragons. The game was locked at 10-10 prior to the hour mark, before the Warriors pulled clear to take the points and cheer up coach Shaun Wane, left behind after a hip operation. The opening quarter saw both sides complete their sets and play on the back of a solid kicking game. Only a brief opportunity saw Brayden Williame go close.
