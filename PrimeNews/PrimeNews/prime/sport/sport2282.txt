Dean Saunders has told talkSPORT Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud would be a perfect signing for Liverpool this summer. Giroud has admitted he is considering leaving the Gunners as he seeks more regular first team football. The 30-year-old does not want to jeopardise his chances of making the France squad for the next year’s World Cup, and the £52million arrival of Alexandre Lacazette means he is likely to experience a reduced role at the Emirates this season.
