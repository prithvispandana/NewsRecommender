Wayne Rooney appears close to finalising his return to boyhood club Everton after being pictured arriving at the Toffees' training ground on Saturday. Sky Sports footage showed the 31-year-old driving into the Merseyside club's Finch Farm base in the afternoon as he nears a switch from Manchester United. Rooney, who is both United and England's all-time record scorer, originally left Everton for Old Trafford in 2004 and talks about him rejoining the Toffees have gathered pace in recent days.
