Former Chelsea captain John Terry has agreed to join Aston Villa, according to reports. The 36-year-old is a free-agent after his contract at Stamford Bridge expired and has told other interested clubs, including Birmingham City, that he has his heart set on a move to Steve Bruceâ€™s side. Terry was pictured on holiday with Bruce during the summer and is expected to sign a one-year deal at Villa Park as the club attempt to return to the Premier League.
