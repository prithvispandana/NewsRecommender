Leeds have signed defender Matthew Pennington on a season-long loan deal from Everton. Centre-half Pennington, 22, has joined up with Leeds' squad in Austria and is expected to be confirmed as head coach Thomas Christiansen's ninth summer signing later on Wednesday. Christiansen has been in the hunt for a central defender since Kyle Bartley returned to parent club Swansea following his season-long loan at Elland Road and Pennington will vie with Pontus Jansson and Liam Cooper for a starting place.
