St Etienne have agreed a fee with Caen for Newcastle United and Southampton target Yann Karamoh. The 19-year-old is in high demand this summer after breaking into the first team last season and bagging five goals in Ligue 1. Newcastle and Southampton have been actively pursuing the striker, while Italian club Fiorentina and French champions Monaco have held talks with him too. But, according to L'Equipe, St Etienne are set to pull off a major coup as they have now agreed a fee for Karamoh.
