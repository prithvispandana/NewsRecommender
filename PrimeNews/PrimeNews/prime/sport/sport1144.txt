Johanna Konta is over the first hurdle at Wimbledon after she exacted swift revenge on her French Open conqueror Hsieh Su-wei and reached the second round. Konta lost to world number 113 Hsieh at Roland Garros less than five weeks ago but a repeat never looked likely on Court One where she cruised to a 6-2 6-2 victory. There was also little sign of the spine injury that forced Konta to withdraw from Eastbourne last week, and the world number seven will face Croatian Donna Vekic or Russia's Natalia Vikhlyantseva in round two.
