Jodie Taylor fired a brilliant hat-trick as England's Lionesses hit Scotland for six in Utrecht. The World Cup bronze medallists made the perfect start to their quest to become European champions for the first time, inflicting a 6-0 defeat on outclassed opponents. Arsenal striker Taylor hit an early double, and when Ellen White poached a third before half-time it was already a grim night for the Scots on their major tournament debut.
