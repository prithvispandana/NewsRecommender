Arsenal should not meet Mesut Ozil's sky-high demands, according to former player Stewart Robson. The German playmaker is out of contract in 2018 and, though he insists he wants to stay, is reportedly asking for up to £400,000-a-week to sign a new deal. But Robson insists the World Cup winner is not worth such a big salary and Arsenal would be 'silly to pay it'.
