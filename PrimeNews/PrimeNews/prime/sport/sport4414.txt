Former England batsman Michael Lumb has announced his retirement with immediate effect. The 37-year-old, who opened for England as they won the World Twenty20 in 2010, has an ankle injury. "I'm extremely disappointed I've had to retire from cricket, particularly in the middle of the season, but I have to respect medical opinion," the Nottinghamshire batsman said. Lumb played in 27 T20 and three one-day internationals for England, scoring his one century in his 50-over debut against West Indies in 2014.
