Fans are growing increasingly optimistic at Elland Road after a busy summer for Leeds United. Since Andrea Radrizzani completed his full takeover of the club in May, the West Yorkshire outfit have had a change of head coach, along with an influx of new players. The Italian has quickly won over fans by investing in the team, engaging on social media and buying back Elland Road after 13 years of renting.
