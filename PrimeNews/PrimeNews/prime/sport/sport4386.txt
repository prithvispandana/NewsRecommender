Kevin Pietersen insists England must ditch Keaton Jennings and Gary Ballance – because they can’t bat! Ballance will miss the third Test against South Africa with a finger injury, while opener Jennings is expected to retain his place at the top of the order, despite a run of low scores. But former England star Pietersen claims there should be no place for either of them in Joe Root’s side, and says the selectors should be looking to Dawid Malan and Jason Roy to fill those spots.
