Everton winger Aaron Lennon is happy to be back in action and has thanked people for their support after he was detained under the Mental Health Act in May. The 30-year-old has been back in pre-season training with the Toffees for the past week following his treatment for a stress-related illness after the police detained him at the side of a road in Salford. Lennon, who was treated at The Priory in Darlington and Altrincham and also the Salford Royal Hospital, took to Twitter to show his gratitude and is looking forward to the new campaign.
