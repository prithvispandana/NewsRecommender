British and Irish Lions flanker Sean O'Brien is free to play in Saturday's Test series decider against New Zealand after a citing complaint was dismissed. O'Brien was reported by match citing commissioner Scott Rowland for allegedly striking New Zealand wing Waisake Naholo during Saturday's second Test. O'Brien denied he committed an offence during a three-man judicial hearing in Wellington on Sunday, with the citing complaint subsequently dismissed, the New Zealand Rugby Union announced.
