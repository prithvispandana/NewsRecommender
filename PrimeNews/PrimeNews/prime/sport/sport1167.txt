Former England striker Dean Ashton has told talkSPORT John Terry was NOT the best defender he ever played against – finding Rio Ferdinand the more fearsome opponent. Terry completed his move to Aston Villa on Monday morning, choosing to drop down to the Championship to link up with Steve Bruce’s side following his departure from Chelsea. The 36-year-old is regarded as one of Chelsea’s and England’s greatest ever footballers, and he left the Blues as their most successful captain ever following his 22-year relationship with the west London club.
