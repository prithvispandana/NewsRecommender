Andy Murray put injury concerns aside as he eased into the second round of Wimbledon. The defending champion needed just one hour 48 minutes to defeat Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik, a lucky loser ranked 134, in straight sets. Murray's preparations have been disrupted by a hip problem that prevented him from practising on Wednesday and Thursday. There was still a pronounced limp between points but the world number one's game was working just fine.
