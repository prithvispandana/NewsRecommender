Liverpool legend Graeme Souness says the Reds are lacking the squad depth to challenge for the Premier League title this season, and should do everything in their power to sign Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk to boost their chances. The Dutch defender was strongly linked with a move to Anfield before the transfer window opened, but the deal appeared to be dead after the Saints accused the Reds of illegally tapping up their star man. However, it is understood they are now back in the hunt after a Premier League investigation excused the Reds of any wrongdoing.
