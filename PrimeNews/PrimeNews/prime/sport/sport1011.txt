Monaco are blocking Benjamin Mendy's move to Manchester City and Arsenal's pursuit of Thomas Lemar. The French club have lost some of their key players already this summer after toppling Paris Saint-Germain last season to win Ligue 1. Midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko is close to joining Chelsea for £35million, while Bernardo Silva has gone to Manchester City for £43m. Star striker Kylian Mbappe is also a target for all of Europe's top clubs and he could leave as a part of a world record deal.
