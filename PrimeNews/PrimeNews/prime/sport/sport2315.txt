Ajax midfielder Abdelhak Nouri has suffered "serious and permanent brain damage" after collapsing during a pre-season friendly on Saturday, the Eredivisie club have announced. The 20-year-old Dutchman required emergency ambulance treatment on the field during a meeting with Werder Bremen in Zillertal, Austria and he was subsequently airlifted to hospital. Ajax, who earlier in the week revealed Nouri had experienced heart arrhythmia, tweeted on Thursday that he had been "diagnosed with serious and permanent brain damage."
