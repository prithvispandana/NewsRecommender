Warren Gatland has insisted he "couldn't give a toss" about the New Zealand Herald mocking him up as a cartoon clown. The British and Irish Lions head coach laughed off New Zealand's daily paper publishing a second clown caricature of him in six months. Gatland admitted he was nonplussed by All Blacks boss Steve Hansen calling a radio station to object to the Lions boss criticising New Zealand's "dangerous" targeting of scrum-half Conor Murray.
