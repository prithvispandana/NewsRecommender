Juventus have not given up hope of signing Manchester United defender Matteo Darmian this summer. The right-back is currently a target for the Italian champions as they look to find a replacement for Dani Alves. Darmian is said to be Juventus' preferred signing, but Manchester United have recently gone cold over the prospect of selling the 27-year-old. Jose Mourinho is reportedly keen to keep hold of the defender and he will only sell if he demands to leave Old Trafford.
