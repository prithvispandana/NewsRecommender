Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers reckons Jonny Hayes offered a taste of things to come after the player opened his Hoops account on Saturday.  The £1.3m capture from Aberdeen netted his first goal for his new club during the 9-0 romp over Shamrock Rovers.  And Rodgers reckons the Dubliner showed plenty to be excited about on his return to his home city.  "When you're an attacking player and come to your new club it's important to get off the mark early,” he told CelticTV.
