Tottenham need to start winning trophies within the next two years or their star players won’t be at the club for much longer, according to Teddy Sheringham. Kyle Walker recently left for Man City and Europe’s biggest clubs are also said to be monitoring Dele Alli, Toby Alderweireld and top scoring striker Harry Kane. Sheringham left White Hart Lane in search of silverware in 1997 and ended up winning the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League with Man United before returning to White Hart Lane in 2001.
