Ross Barkley is demanding Tottenham pay him £150,000-a-week, which would make him the highest paid player at the club.  Star striker Harry Kane and captain Hugo Lloris both earn around £120,000-a-week, but Barkley is wants Spurs to break their wage structure to sign him.  The north Londoners have refused to meet that demand and there is also a huge gap in Everton and Spurs' valuation of the midfielder.  The Toffees wants £50million for their England international while Tottenham value him at just £15m, according to the Mirror.
