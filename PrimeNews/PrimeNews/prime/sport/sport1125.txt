Ipswich have completed the loan signing of Manchester City winger Bersant Celina until the end of the season. The 20-year-old, who made one Premier League appearance under Manuel Pellegrini at City, is the fifth signing by Mick McCarthy this season after the club fought off competition to sign him. The Kosovo international spent last season on loan at FC Twente, scoring five times in 27 Eredivisie appearances and follows Jordan Spence, Joe Garner, Emyr Huws and Tom Adeyemi through the door at Portman Road.
