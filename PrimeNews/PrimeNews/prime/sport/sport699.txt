With captain John Terry having left the club and Nathan Ake sold to Bournemouth, the Premier League champions are in need of a new centre-back. VirgilÂ van Dijk has been heavily linked with the Blues but Southampton are determined to keep the Dutchman and have insisted they will not entertain any offers.
