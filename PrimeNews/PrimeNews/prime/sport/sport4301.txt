Juventus have completed the signing of goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny from Arsenal and expect to add Italy full-back Mattia De Sciglio to their squad in due course. Szczesny, 27, spent the last two seasons on loan with Juve's Serie A rivals Roma but has now agreed to compete with the veteran Gianluigi Buffon for the gloves at the Allianz Stadium. The fee is reportedly 11.3 million euros (Â£10million) for a player who made almost 200 appearances in all competitions for Arsenal before losing his place to David Ospina during the 2014-15 campaign.
