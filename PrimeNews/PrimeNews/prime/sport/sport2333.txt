New manager Frank de Boer will take a good look in Crystal Palace's "own kitchen" before deciding where to further strengthen the squad. Chelsea's 21-year-old midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek was confirmed on Wednesday as the first arrival following the Dutchman's appointment. Defender Jairo Riedewald is expected to soon head to Selhurst Park in a Â£7.5million transfer from De Boer's former club Ajax.
