Jose Mourinho has hinted Manchester United could re-sign Zlatan Ibrahimovic when he recovers from the major knee surgery he underwent at the end of last season. The Swedish striker, who scored 28 goals for the Red Devils before he suffered ligament damage to his right knee playing in the Europa League in April, was released when his one-year contract expired at the end of June.
