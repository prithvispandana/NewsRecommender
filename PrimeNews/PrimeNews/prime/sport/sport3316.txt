It has long been thought that Marco Verratti is the heir to Andres Iniesta in the Barcelona midfield. Naturally, Paris Saint-Germain are keen to keep the Italian in an effort to challenge for the Champions League and have signed Dani Alves to boost the squad. "I came here to play with Marco Verratti, that’s the message I want him to get. I hope he can help us win the Champions League," Alves said during his first press conference as a PSG player.
