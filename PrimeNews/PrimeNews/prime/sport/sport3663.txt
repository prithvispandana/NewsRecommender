Roma are considering a move for Manchester City defender Aleksandar Kolarov. The Serbian is into the final year of his contract at the Etihad and he is yet to begin talks over an extension. As a result, the left-back may well be shown the exit door this summer and clubs are ready to pounce if he does leave. Kolarov's former side Lazio have been linked with a swoop, while Turkish giants Besiktas are also monitoring his situation. But, according to TMW, Roma are now also ready to throw their hat into the ring for the 31-year-old.
