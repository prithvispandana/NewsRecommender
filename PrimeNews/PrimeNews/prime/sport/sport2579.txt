Ronald Koeman has admitted Everton midfielder Ross Barkley's future remains unclear. The Toffees boss has repeatedly warned the 23-year-old that if he did not sign a new deal this summer, he would have to be sold given his current contract expires next year. However, Barkley has not penned fresh terms and is still an Everton player.
