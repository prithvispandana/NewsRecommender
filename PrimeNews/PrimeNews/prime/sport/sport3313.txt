Edwin van der Sar and Peter Schmeichel are widely considered to be Man United’s two greatest goalkeepers and Jaap Stam is lucky enough to have played with both of them. The current Reading manager joined United in 1998 when Schmeichel was the club’s no.1, while he spent many years playing with Van der Sar in the Netherlands team. But who was better? It’s a difficult choice, as there was nothing to separate them as shot-stoppers, according to Stam, but Van der Sar had a slight edge.
