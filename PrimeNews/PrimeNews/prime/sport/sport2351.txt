Barcelona are set to win the race for Benfica defender Nelson Semedo. The Spanish club are on the hunt for a new right-back this summer and they have been assessing a number of options. Arsenal's Hector Bellerin and Cesar Azpilicueta of Chelsea have been linked with moves to the Camp Nou, but both deals have failed to get off the ground. And now, according to Marca, Barcelona are instead close to wrapping up a deal for Semedo instead. The 23-year-old is in talks with Barca and they have sent representatives to Benfica to help push the transfer over the line.
