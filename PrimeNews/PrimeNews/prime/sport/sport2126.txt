Real Sociedad have announced the signing of winger Adnan Januzaj from Manchester United. It is understood the 22-year-old has joined the LaLiga outfit for an initial £8million - although the fee could rise to £9.8million - and that United have a buyback clause for the Belgium international. Januzaj sensationally broke into the United team as an 18-year-old, hitting two goals on his full debut against Sunderland in 2013. Since then his stock has fallen and, after two forgettable loan stints at Borussia Dortmund and Sunderland, he has now moved on.
