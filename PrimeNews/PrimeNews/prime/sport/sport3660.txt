Everton have announced the signing of former Southampton defender Cuco Martina on a three-year deal. The 27-year-old defender arrives at Goodison Park on a free transfer, having seen his contract with Saints expire at the end of the 2016/17 season. Primarily a right-back, Martina will link up with Ronald Koeman once again, having worked under the Dutchman for one year at St Mary's.
