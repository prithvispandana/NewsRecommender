Striker Romelu Lukaku appears to have learned from his previous experience under Jose Mourinho after admitting he will have to "work harder than ever before" when his move to Manchester United is confirmed. The Belgium international is on the verge of completing a potential world-record move to Old Trafford, with the Red Devils paying an initial Â£75million plus several add-ons. It will reunite him with United boss Mourinho, the man who sold him as a raw 21-year-old at Chelsea after just 15 matches and no goals.
