Huddersfield have promoted teenage goalkeeper Ryan Schofield to their first-team squad. England Under-20 international Schofield, 17, who featured for the Terriers' under-18s last season, will work alongside the club's new head of goalkeeping Paul Clements. "Everyone knows that Ryan is a talented young goalkeeper," Huddersfield head coach David Wagner told the club's official website. "He will now move into the first-team changing room and train with us every day while also continuing to play games for our academy sides and this will help him develop."
