Sergio Romero has been rewarded with a new deal at Manchester United, keeping the goalkeeper at the club until at least 2021. The Argentina international moved to Old Trafford two years ago and has proved a more than able deputy to first-choice David De Gea. Romero has impressed when called upon and started the Europa League final - his 28th United appearance in all competitions over the past two seasons. The 30-year-old's displays have seen him rewarded with a new and improved contract until 2021, plus the option to extend by a further year.
