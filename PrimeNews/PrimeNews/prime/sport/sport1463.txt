The Tour de France demands dedication and physical excellence. Rivals ride shoulder to shoulder in a battle to seize top spot and claim the glory that every competitor yearns for. But Mark Cavendish was on the wrong end of a tussle after breaking his shoulder blade in a controversial collision with double champion Peter Sagan. In the final sprint Sagan used his elbow to send Cavendish crashing into the barriers at 40mph. Unfortunately Cavendish was forced to withdraw from the famous event while Sagan was disqualified for his actions.
