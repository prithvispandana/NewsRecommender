Antonio Conte has agreed a new two-year deal with Chelsea having guided the west London club to the Premier League title last season. The Italian has put pen to paper on improved terms, though it is believed the deal is NOT an extension; he signed a three-year contact last summer, and this new two-year deal is still set to expire in the summer of 2019. It is hard to deny Conte deserves an improved deal, given Chelsea's excellence in 2016/17, and fans are hoping the Blues emulate their impressive form this coming campaign.
