Arsene Wenger has revealed he has been in constant contact with Alexis Sanchez this summer and is 'positive' he will remain at Arsenal. Sanchez is in the final 12 months of his contract and is at loggerheads with the club over a new deal, with the Chilean said to be demanding a staggering £400,000-a-week to extend his stay. Premier League rivals Manchester City are keeping a close eye on the 28-year-old's situation and have been tipped to launch a big-money bid for his services this summer.
