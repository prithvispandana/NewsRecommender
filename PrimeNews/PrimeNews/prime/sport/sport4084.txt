Gary Ballance has been ruled out of the third Investec Test with a broken finger, the England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed on Tuesday evening. Ballance was hit on the left index finger by Morne Morkel in the second innings of England's defeat against South Africa at Trent Bridge. The Yorkshire batsman did not initially think he had broken his finger and, after treatment on the field, was able to resume his innings. However, following consultation with a hand surgeon in Leeds, a fracture was diagnosed.
