Leicester midfielder Nampalys Mendy could be set for a return to France with Bordeaux after reportedly saying he wants to join the Ligue 1 club. The 25-year-old moved to then-Premier League champions Leicester from Nice last summer on a four-year contract, for a Â£13million fee. But his season was blighted by an ankle injury which limited him to just nine appearances in all competitions.
