Leicester defender Robert Huth will miss the start of the Premier League season after undergoing ankle surgery which will rule him out for two months. The 32-year-old has gone under the knife to repair some minor damage he sustained in pre-season training and faces up to eight weeks on the sidelines, the Foxes announced on their official website. He will not join the rest of his team-mates on their tour to Hong Kong, where they take part in the Premier League Asia Trophy, instead staying at home to begin his rehab.
