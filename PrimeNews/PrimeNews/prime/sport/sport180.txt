Chelsea are on the verge of completing a £60million deal for Juventus left-back Alex Sandro, according to reports in Italy. The Blues have been chasing the 26-year-old all summer and he is keen on heading to Stamford Bridge. Juventus had initially refused to consider selling the Brazilian, who was a key player in their run to the Champions League final last season. But, according to La Stampa, Chelsea are now putting the final touches to a £60m swoop for the defender.
