Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has insisted Alexis Sanchez will NOT be sold by the club this summer. Sanchez only has one year left on his contract at the Emirates StadiumÂ and hinted he had made his mind up to leave after stating his desire to play in the Champions League. That has given Arsenal, who are set for Europa League football this season, a dilemma whether to cash in on the forward or potentially see him leave for free next summer, a risk they appear happy to take.
