Graeme Souness has urged Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge to improve his attitude or risk ruining his last chance at a top club. Once the Reds’ main man up front, Sturridge’s role at the club is now unclear after steadily falling down the pecking order under Jurgen Klopp. The 27-year-old made 20 Premier League appearances last season, but only seven of those were starts, and he scored just three league goals as he continued to struggle with fitness.
