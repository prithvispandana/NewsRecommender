Andy Murray has announced he is fit to defend his title at Wimbledon following a recent hip injury scare. The world number one pulled out of two warm-up matches earlier in the week as he battled to secure peak fitness. But on Sunday he dismissed fears he may have to pull out, saying: "I'll be fine to play the event and play seven matches." Murray faces Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik at 1pm on Monday, in the opening match on Centre Court. Murray also confirmed reports he and wife Kim are expecting their second child.
