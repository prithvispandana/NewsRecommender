Italy international Angelo Ogbonna has signed a new five-year deal at West Ham, the Premier League side announced on Friday. The 29-year-old missed almost the entire second half of last season having undergone knee surgery in January, returning only for the Hammers' final Premier League game of the campaign in a 2-1 win at Burnley. Ogbonna has now penned a fresh contract to keep him at the London Stadium until 2022, having originally signed for Slaven Bilic's side from Juventus in 2015.
