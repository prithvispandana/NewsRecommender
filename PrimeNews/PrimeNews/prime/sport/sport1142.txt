Heather Watson continued her fine form on grass with victory over Maryna Zanevska to reach the second round of Wimbledon. The British number two has had a difficult season but turned things around last week in Eastbourne by reaching the semi-finals. It was the confidence boost Watson needed and she took advantage of a kind draw against Belgium's Maryna Zanevska to win 6-1 7-6 (7/5). There was a wobble at the end of the second set as Watson missed three match points and was taken to a tie-break, but she held on.
