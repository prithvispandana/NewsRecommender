Monaco and Sevilla have joined Arsenal in the hunt for Norwegian teen star Sander Berge. The midfielder has been in fine form for Genk in Belgium after joining them from Norwegian club Valerenga in January. The 19-year-old has impressed so much that Arsenal want to bring him to the Emirates and there has been talk of an £18million deal. Berge is clearly not short of suitors though and, according to reports in Spain, Monaco and Sevilla are now interested too.
