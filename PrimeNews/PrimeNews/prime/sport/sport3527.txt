Thomas Lemar has told Monaco he wants to be sold this summer after reportedly agreeing personal terms over a move to Arsenal. The 21-year-old winger is said to be desperate to join the Gunners and is excited to work under Arsene Wenger at the Emirates Stadium. According to The Sun, the France international has agreed a long-term contract worth round Â£90,000-a-week with the north London club. However, Monaco are hesitant to allow another one of their stars to leave and have their Ligue 1-winning squad ripped apart this summer.
