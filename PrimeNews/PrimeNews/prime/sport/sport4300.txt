Turkish giants Fenerbahce are set for showdown talks with the entourage of out-of-favour Arsenal star Lucas Perez. The 28-year-old Spaniard has fallen down the pecking order at the Emirates Stadium following the recent arrival of record signing Alexandre Lacazette. Perez, a £17million signing from Deportivo last summer, made just 22 appearances in all competitions for the Gunners in his first season, scoring eight goals.
