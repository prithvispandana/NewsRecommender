Arsenal will not sell Alexis Sanchez this summer, according to manager Arsene Wenger. Sanchez last week stated his desire to play in the Champions League and hinted his mind was made up to leave the Gunners. The 28-year-old only has one year left on his contract, giving Arsenal a dilemma whether to cash in on the forward or potentially see him leave for free next summer. Wenger, speaking ahead of Wednesday's friendly against Bayern Munich in China, told reporters: "The decision has been made and we will stick to that."
