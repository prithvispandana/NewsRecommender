Liverpool midfielder Kevin Stewart has flown home from the club's pre-season trip to Hong Kong to complete a move to Hull. The 23-year-old left the squad, who are in the Far East to play in the Premier League Asia Trophy, to finalise the details of a move which could eventually cost the Tigers up to £8million. However, it is understood the move is not tied in with a deal for the Championship side's left-back Andrew Robertson to go in the opposite direction and Liverpool will pursue that separately.
