Chelsea are close to wrapping up the signing of Alvaro Morata from Real Madrid for a club-record fee, according to reports. The Spanish striker was widely expected to join Manchester United this summer before the Red Devils recruited Romelu Lukaku from under the noses of Antonio Conte’s men. It is believed the Blues are prepared to shell out £75million to land the 24-year-old and break the club’s previous transfer record, when they signed Fernando Torres for £50million in 2011.
