Manchester United and Real Madrid target Gianluigi Donnarumma is set for showdown talks with AC Milan on Monday. The goalkeeper has been locked in negotiations over a new contract with the San Siro club for months now and still no agreement has been reached. The 18-year-old has just one year to run on his current deal and Milan are desperate to tie him down, but the player's agent – Mino Raiola – has claimed his client is being bullied during talks.
