Hull KR have announced the signing of Leeds captain Danny McGuire. The 34-year-old former Great Britain half-back, who is Super League's all-time leading try-scorer, has signed a two-year contract with the Robins, who are hoping to make a quick return to Super League following relegation in 2016. Hull KR coach Tim Sheens said: "Danny will really add to our squad for next year. He's had a few clubs looking at him but I think he liked what he heard about us and the things we spoke about."
