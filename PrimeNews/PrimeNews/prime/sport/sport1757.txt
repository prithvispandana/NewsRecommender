Jonny Bairstow's defiant half-century helped England set South Africa the second-highest run-chase total at Lord's to win the first Investec Test. England lost seven wickets for 43 runs on an eventful fourth morning, but Bairstow - dropped on just seven by Vernon Philander at long-off - responded with a 74-ball half-century in a second-innings 233 all out which left the tourists with a taxing target of 331 in the remaining four-and-a-half sessions.
