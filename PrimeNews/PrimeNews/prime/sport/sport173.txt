Everton are understood to have agreed a deal to sign Nigerian starlet Henry Onyekuru. The 20-year-old has been tracked by a host of clubs having topped the Belgian goalscoring charts last season. He fired 22 goals in 38 games for KAS Eurpen and was recently called up the Nigeria national squad. Arsenal were interested in signing Onyekuru but he has instead opted to join Premier League rivals Everton. The Toffees triggered the £6.8m release clause in his contract and he is believed to have completed a medical at their training ground on Monday evening.
