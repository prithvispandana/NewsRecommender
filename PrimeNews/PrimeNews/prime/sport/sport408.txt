Inter Milan are preparing an offer of £52.5m plus bonuses for Chelsea target Radja Nainggolan. The midfielder has been heavily linked with a move away from Roma for over a year now and he could finally leave this summer. Chelsea are long-term admirers of the Belgian, but their bid for Monaco star Tiemoue Bakayoko has given other clubs hope that they could land Nainggolan in front of them. One of those, according to Telelombardia, is Inter and they are putting the final touches to a bid worth £52.5m plus bonuses.
