Borja Baston has joined LaLiga side Malaga on a season-long loan deal, Swansea City have confirmed. The Spanish striker moved to Wales for a club-record Â£13.5m fee last summer, but endured a torrid time in the Premier League. He played only 18 league matches for the Swans and scored just one goal - netting in a 3-2 defeat at Arsenal. The 24-year-old returns to his homeland for the 2017/18 campaign, having spent all his career prior to moving to Swansea in Spain.
