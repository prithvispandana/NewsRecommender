Brighton goalkeeper Niki Maenpaa has signed a new one-year contract. The 32-year-old Finland international was back-up to David Stockdale last season as the Seagulls secured promotion to the Premier League. With Stockdale having departed for Birmingham, Maenpaa will vie with new signing Mathew Ryan for the number-one spot. Seagulls boss Chris Hughton said: "Niki has been a great asset for the club over the past two years, and I am really pleased he has committed his future to the club.
