Some people think football is a matter of life and death. And surgeons in Chile did little to dampen that theory after halting an operation to celebrate their nationâ€™s Confederations Cup semi-final win over Portugal on penalties.

The team of medics can be seen dancing with glee as their patient appears to be unconscious.
