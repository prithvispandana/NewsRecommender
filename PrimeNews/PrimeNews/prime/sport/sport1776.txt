Listen to Max Rushden and Barry Glendenning tackle the important - and utterly trivial - sporting matters of the day in another edition of the Warm Up. Guests include Lewis Moody and Darren Lewis, while Francis Leach joins the guys in the studio for the 'Australian Hour'. Meanwhile, Ryan Sidebottom is the latest subject of 'Cricketers are Nice', and there is another thrilling edition of Ian Culverhouse.
