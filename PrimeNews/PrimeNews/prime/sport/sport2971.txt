Chelsea are reportedly close to sealing a stunning club record £65million swoop for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The Premier League champions are desperate to land a new striker, with Diego Costa on his way out of the club. Costa has been told he can leave Stamford Bridge, despite playing an integral role in the title triumph last term, and was granted permission to miss the start of pre-season training this week.
