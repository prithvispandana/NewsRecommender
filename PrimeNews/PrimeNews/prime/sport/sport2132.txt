Tottenham Hotspur are, once again, standing firm in the face of transfer interest in one of their stars. It’s hardly a rare occurrence; even in their toughest times during the Premier League era at least a top club has coveted one of their players. Currently Eric Dier is flavour of the month and Manchester United want to sign the versatile England international. Some reports suggest Dier may want a move to the club he supported as a boy, but others say he’s happy with the club and Tottenham won’t entertain any bids.
