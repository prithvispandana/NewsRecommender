Cristiano Ronaldo will not be returning to Man United this summer, with manager Jose Mourinho admitting a move for the club's former player has always been "mission impossible". Last month the 32-year-old Real Madrid striker became disgruntled as he felt singled out for disproportionate treatment by Spanish prosecutors, who accused him of evading tax of 14.7million euros (£12.8m). Those allegations were denied in a statement by Ronaldo's management company, Gestifute, and the player was believed to have told those close to him he wanted to quit both the club and Spain.
