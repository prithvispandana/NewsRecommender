Leicester's owners have emphatically denied allegations of corruption in Thailand. According to reports, King Power is facing a multimillion-pound lawsuit for allegedly failing to pay the Thai government money due from the operation of the company's duty free franchise at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport. Reports say that the company is alleged to have paid the government only three per cent of the income when under the franchise, granted in 2006, they were required to hand over 15 per cent.
