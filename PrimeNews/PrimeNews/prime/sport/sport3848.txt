Jose Mourinho has said he has "no idea" what is happening with Manchester United's move for Inter Milan winger Ivan Perisic. The Red Devils have already signed Benfica defender Victor Lindelof and Everton striker Romelu Lukaku so far this summer. But Mourinho still wants two more signings and a move for Inter's Perisic is reportedly edging towards completion. Asked for an update on the transfer after the 2-1 friendly win at Real Salt Lake, Mourinho said as he left the press conference: "No idea. No idea my friend. No idea."
