Swansea have announced Gylfi Sigurdsson has not travelled with the rest of the squad for the pre-season tour of the United States. The club say the Icelandic playmaker is 'not in the right frame of mind to travel' after Everton tabled a £40m bid for his services. Swansea have not yet accepted the offer but it is understood that Sigurdsson is keen to make the move and will hold talks with chairman Huw Jenkins over his future on Thursday.
