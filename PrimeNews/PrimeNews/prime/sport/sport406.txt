Liverpool are tracking Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico, according to reports in Spain. The Reds have been linked with signing a new goalkeeper this summer as doubts remain over the futures of Loris Karius and Simon Mignolet. Rico has impressed in recent seasons in Spain and he can be snapped up this summer if someone activates his Â£26m release-clause. AC Milan are keeping tabs on the 23-year-old in case they need to replace contract rebel Gianluigi Donnarumma but, according to COPE, Liverpool are in the hunt too.
