Former Arsenal, Chelsea and Real Madrid midfielder Lassana Diarra has joined UAE side Al Jazira. The France international has been without a club since February after his contract was terminated by Marseille. The French side had deemed the 32-year-old surplus to requirements and he was released with the expectation being he would secure a move to China. That move, however, never materialised and Diarra has been searching for a new club ever since. But, the midfielder's search is now over after he put pen to paper on a deal which sees him join Al Jazira.
