West Brom have completed the signing of Jay Rodriguez from Southampton for a reported Â£12million fee. The Baggies have long been liked with the 27-year-old England international and chose a novel way to announce his arrival. Responding to a tweet from a fan asking if they had signed anyone yet, Albion replied with a four-second clip of Rodriguez saying "yes we have". Saints say they have received an undisclosed fee for Rodriguez who made 126 appearances for them after joining from Burnley in 2012.
