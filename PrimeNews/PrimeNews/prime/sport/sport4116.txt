Billy Joe Saunders has told talkSPORT the only way Conor McGregor will beat Floyd Mayweather is if their fight is fixed from the start. Five-division worldÂ champion Mayweather will clash with UFC icon McGregor in August, in a boxing match billed as the '180 Million Dollar Dance'. The former is heavy favourite to win, seeing as the fight is taking place in the code to which he has devoted his life and enjoyed a remarkably successful career, and McGregor, in fact, is being widely written off.
