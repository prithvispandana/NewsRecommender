Leicester City and Roma are battling it out for Sassuolo striker Gregoire Defrel. The Frenchman struck 12 times in Italy last season and he is ready to move on this summer. The 26-year-old has previously been linked with a move to Southampton, while Ligue 1 sides are tracking him too. But now, according to Sky Sport Italia, it is Leicester and Roma who are fighting hard to snap up Defrel during the current transfer window. Both clubs are reportedly ready to part with around Â£15m to land the forward, but they may well need to up their offers.
