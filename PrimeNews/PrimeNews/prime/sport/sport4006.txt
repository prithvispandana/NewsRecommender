Football fans have been praising Stoke City after the Premier League club vowed to cover away supporters' coaches next season. The offer covers every league game on the road, with official buses organised by the club departing from the bet365 Stadium for all 19 away days. It is the fifth successive season they have done the kind gesture - after becoming the first club in any of Englandâ€™s top four divisions to do so in 2013 - and the club say more than 12,500 fans took up the offer last term.
