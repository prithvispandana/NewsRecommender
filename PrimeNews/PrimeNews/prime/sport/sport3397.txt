Clarke Carlise has told talkSPORT of his relief after leaving Leeds United in 2005 and how he got one over on then-chairman Ken Bates. He joined the West Yorkshire club in 2004, months after their relegation from the Premier League, and went on to make 35 appearances, even contributing four goals. A financially-stricken United side finished in 14th and, in the following summer, new boss Kevin Blackwell allowed Carlisle to move to Watford, where he signed a three-year deal.
