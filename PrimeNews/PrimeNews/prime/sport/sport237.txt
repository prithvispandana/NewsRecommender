Premier League champions Chelsea have been linked with part-exchange deal for Sevilla star Vitolo. The 27-year-old, full name Victor Machin Perez, impressed last season, scoring six goals in 30 LaLiga appearances. A move to Atletico Madrid looked on the cards for the winger but that seems to have broken down as a result of their transfer ban. And now, according to Marca, Chelsea are leading the race to land him this summer. Vitolo's release clause is set at Â£35m but it has been suggested that the Stamford Bridge club may look to land him in a swap deal.
