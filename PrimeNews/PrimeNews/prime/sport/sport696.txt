Alexandre Lacazette is on the verge of completing a move to Arsenal. The Gunners are willing to break their transfer record to sign the Lyon striker and Lacazette is keen on the move. Arsenal have been in advanced negotiations with the French club over the last few days and it is understood that they are close to agreeing a deal worth around £50million. The France international could complete his move to the Emirates as early as next week. The deal for Lacazette would eclipse the £42.5m Arsenal paid for Mesut Ozil in 2013.
