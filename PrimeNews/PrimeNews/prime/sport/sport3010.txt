Phil Neville believes it will be a fight between Manchester City and Manchester United for the Premier League title this season. The near neighbours failed to mount a challenge for the trophy in 2016-17 with the much-anticipated match-up between bosses Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho failing to live up to its billing. But with City and United having each splashed out more than £100m this summer - and more big-money signings set to follow - Neville is expecting big things from both teams.
