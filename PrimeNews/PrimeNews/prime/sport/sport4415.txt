England captain Dylan Hartley has signed a new contract with Northampton and has been reappointed as the Premiership club's skipper. The 31-year old previously had the armband between 2009 and 2015 - the club's most successful period which brought the Aviva Premiership, European Rugby Challenge Cup and Anglo-Welsh Cup trophies to Franklin's Gardens. Hartley, capped 86 times by England, has made 229 appearances for Saints since joining them from Worcester in 2006. He had a year remaining on his existing contract.
