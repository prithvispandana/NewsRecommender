AC Milan have confirmed the signing of Sunderland forward Fabio Borini on loan with an obligation to buy. The 26-year-old returns to his homeland after grabbing two goals last season as the Black Cats tumbled out of the Premier League and into the Championship. The former Chelsea and Liverpool man signed for Sunderland permanently in 2015 for a fee in the region of Â£8million after a promising loan spell with the club during the 2013/14 season.
