Ben Currie made a dramatic comeback from a 10-month injury lay-off with a try that kept alive Warrington's Super League top-eight hopes. The Wolves trailed for most of the Grand Final rematch at the DW Stadium but Currie's 56th-minute try proved decisive as they pulled off a surprise 16-10 win over Wigan to ruin Sean O'Loughlin's 400th appearance.
