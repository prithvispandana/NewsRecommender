Man City have agreed a £50m fee with Tottenham to sign Kyle Walker, according to reports. The 27-year-old right-back is expected to cost £45m, with £5m in add-ons and will head to Manchester on Friday to undergo a medical. City have been linked with Walker all summer and, having missed out on Dani Alves, moved quickly to close a deal for the Spurs and England man. The £50m fee will equal the record PSG set when they bought David Luiz from Chelsea in 2014.
