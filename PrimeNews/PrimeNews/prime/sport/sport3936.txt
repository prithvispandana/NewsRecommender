Bordeaux have joined Nantes in the race for Leicester City midfielder Nampalys Mendy. The 25-year-old only joined the Foxes last summer after they shelled out a then club record fee of Â£13million to sign him from Nice. However, the Frenchman endured a difficult first campaign in England and he ended up making just four Premier League appearances last season. Mendy is now ready to leave Leicester in search of more action and Nantes have expressed an interest in him.
