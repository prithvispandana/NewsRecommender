A good thing about a city is that it stays the same. Its man-made skyline might be altered, but something about the city just cannot be taken out and replaced. The only thing that changes is us. I once came to Hong Kong as a ten-year-old kid on a vacation. Returning fifteen years later, this time with a heavier heart, I try to reconnect with that child to find out what he saw and how he felt in this strange city.
