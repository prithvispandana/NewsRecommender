When we're trying to speed up some part of our code, we want quick, targeted
feedback about how our changes perform against the initial implementation. It's
common practice to write a _microbenchmark_: a small program that runs just the
code you're interested in and measures how well it performs. But be warned:
microbenchmarks are fraught with peril, even for experts.
