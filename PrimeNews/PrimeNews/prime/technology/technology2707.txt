In this tutorial we'll dive in Topic Mining. We'll analyze a dataset of newsfeed extracted from more than 60 sources. We'll show how to process it, analyze it and extract visual clusters from it. We'll be using great python tools for interactive visualization, topic mining and text analytics. All the code is available to you to run and test. No bullshit.
