Which programming skills should spend your limited time and energy on, which engineering skills are really in demand? There will always be another fad framework that will soon fade from memory; the time you spend learning it might turn out to be wasted. And job listings ask for ever-changing, not very reasonable combinations of skills: “We want 5 years experience with AngularJS, a deep knowledge of machine learning, and a passion for flyfishing!” Which skills are really in demand, which will continue to be in demand, and which can safely be ignored? The truth is that the skills employers want are not the skills they actually need: the gap between the two can be a problem, but if you present yourself right it can also be an opportunity.
