Kristina Bergman made an unusual decision when she founded Integris Software in early 2016: she included an anti-sexual harassment clause firmly in her company's voting agreement with investors. The clause calls for an investigation should any board director be accused of sexual harassment. If it is found that there was “reasonable probability” that an incident occurred, the director would be removed.
