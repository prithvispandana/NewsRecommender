In a few months, beginning 1 August 2017, there may be some turbulence ahead for the Bitcoin network.
Bitcoin Core full-nodes comprise more than 95% of the Bitcoin network and are susceptible to CVE-2017-9230. BIP 148 upgraded nodes would fix this security vulnerability.
Don't be scared though since this serious CVE bug and security vulnerability is being intensively reviewed by the technical community. If you run and rely on the most recent version of a Bitcoin Core full-node then you should be 99% safe (but for the 1% chance)!
The UASF will result from a fork of Bitcoin Core and BIP 148 coins that will be listed by Bitfinex.
To be clear, you will need to be running two full-nodes: (1) legacy Bitcoin Core and (2) BIP 148 enforcing Bitcoin Core fork. We assume you have an understanding of best practices as outlined in the Glacier Protocol.
