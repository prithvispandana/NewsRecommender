People often ask how important automated testing really is. Today it’s a no-brainer. Here’s why... The average user, just like you and me, opens tens of web pages daily. Most of us leave a web site after 3 seconds of delay. We just do not possess the time to wait for it to load and there are still dozens of other open tabs to explore. Websites get closed, conversions are butchered and businesses run out of clients, simply because we do not have that extra second.
