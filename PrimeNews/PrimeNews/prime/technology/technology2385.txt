This blog includes two statements. One from Dries Buytaert, as Drupal Project Lead, and another from Megan Sanicki, as the Executive Director of the Drupal Association and the Drupal Association Board. We recognize that events and conversations earlier this year surfaced many concerns and needs within the community. One in particular is related to Larry Garfield’s role within Drupal. After several conversations with Larry, and careful consideration, we can now provide an update to this situation, our decisions, and Larry’s role moving forward.
